On Focus

 More

In an age where distractions abound, focus has become the new commodity. Retaining focus, garnering others focus, maintaining our own focus.

Maintaining focus has become a such sticking point for so many. How do we keep it? How is it so easily lost? What tools can we use to find it, induce it, or retain it?

As my business has grown, Ive come to realize that focus isnt some elusive beast that we must track down and capture. Rather, it is merely a state that comes to us through our own desires and drive. Being driven to or desiring to achieve particular goals induces a state of focusedness. While we may weave in and out of this state at different times, our underlying drive is what ultimately brings us back and allows us to reacquire this state.

It is possible to spend days, even weeks, trying different tools and techniques suggested by experts in the field, imitating what successful people do. Yet, it seems many of these experts and successful people forget where their own success arises from their drive. The activities they do and tools they use merely trigger reminders of their purpose, rather than creating some zenlike state of focus from nothingness.

If youre constantly seeking focus and it seems nowhere to be found, you may need to ask yourself how driven are you, truly, in what you do?
