>Lego Mindstorms NXT 2.0 is a toy that teaches you to build and program robots. If your kids are  10 years old or above, Lego Mindstorms will give them a jumpstart on a high paying, fun career in the future. And your kids wont even know it because theyll be having so much fun learning and building. Lego Mindstorms has been  designed in such a way that the depth and complex projects are great for adults, so if you are thinking of a career change, this is a great place to start.
>
>Mechanical Construction Skills. Follow the  included instruction guide and you learn the creation  process of a few starter robots. You will learn basic mechanical  engineering in action as you connect axles to drive gears to motors  to power a moving car. You will learn about levers, fulcrums, and  pivot points that allow you to open and close claws. You will learn about  axis rotations to move and turn robot arms. And this is just to get  started. As you build your own robots, youll develop and intuitive  understanding of concepts like movement, force, and acceleration  through playing and experimentation. The average salary of a  Mechanical Engineer is 80,000.

>Computer Programming Skills. After you have created  the body of your robot, you must breathe life into it by writing a  software program. The software program will tell the robot
>
>how to  move, what to see and sense, how to react. Lego has created their  own programming language that is easy to understand and use. In  fact, it is a bit like playing with Legos as you drag and drop  programming instructions on a computer. This is a good introduction  into the world of software and programming. Once you understand the  basic principles of programming, you can easily transition this  knowledge to other popular programming languages like Javascript,  Python, Java, and C. The average  salary of a Software Engineer is 90,000.

>Goal Completion Reinforcement. The  most important quality of any employee is the ability to get things  done. No matter how smart or talented you may be, at the end of the  day, your vocational value is based on your ability to get your work  done. When you have an idea for a robot, or when you see an example  of a robot to build, you make a goal for yourself. With  concentration and focus, you bring your idea into this world and  bring it to life. For some ideas on robots and goals to make, check  out my favorite introductory book on Mindstorms.

>Accelerated Learning Programs in School. Although the  names differ between
>
>schools, many schools have program specifically  for kids with extra talent and interest in learning. These programs often used things like mousetraps and pingpong balls to  build contraptions and encourage the students. The school programs  have started using Lego sets and Lego Mindstorms to teach inspire  the kids. This Google search shows you what Im talking about.
>
>Problem Solving Skills. All employment is based around  solving problems. You pay to solve the problem of needing shelter,  the problem of needing clothes, and the problem of
>
>being bored. As  you are designing and creating a robot, you will run into problems  that need to solve, both mechanical and in the software. Why  does my robot fall over when it walks? Why doesnt my rover detect  the wall? Why doesnt my scorpion close its claws when it catches  its prey? Often times, there will be many ways to solve a specific  problem. Working and experimenting with what works and what doesnt helps build confidence in solving pratical problems.
>
>Inventing and Entrepreneurial Skills. The kind of  successful career you want for your kids doesnt involve them  working at Mc. Donalds. Or at least not forever. The wealthiest,  most successful people are those that create new things. Building,  dreaming, constructing, and imaging are all critical skills for an  entrepreneur. Any construction and creative toys are good for this,  but Ive found Lego Mindstorms particularly exceptional. Think  about how much you played with Legos as a child and how much your  kids currently love Legos.

>Its Where All The Good Jobs Will Be in the Future. More and more jobs are based around technology
>
>and software. Ask  yourself this question, Do you think there will be less of a  demand for people who know how to make robots and write software in  future? Robots are doing more things everyday for people in their  homes and in their businesses. Encourage your kids to make the new robots of the future, rather than have their jobs  replaced by them.
>
>As a final note, I recognize that Legos are expensive. Lego Mindstorms can also be expensive. I searched ebay to find a good deal. I learned Lego Mindstorm  kits are exceptional at retaining their value. In other words, after you buy Lego Mindstorms , you can always offload it at ebay if you need to, and sometimes make a profit. I struggled with the cost of the kit until I thought about the points that Ive made in this article. I believe giving my kids exposure to computers is critical for their future success. Giving my kids exposure to Lego Mindstorms is just as important to help them in school now, and inventing and selling the robots of the future later.
