The Truth, the Whole Truth, and Nothing But the Truth Why Sales People Lie to their Clients  and Why You Need to Stop

Click here after you've done printing

By Colleen Francis

Ask most people to describe a sales person, and likely as not, you'll  find yourself deluged by words like huckster, snake  oil peddler, fast talker, con artist and, of course, untrustworthy, arrogant and dishonest.

Those of us who work in sales and know ourselves to be fine, upstanding  people may wonder exactly what we ever did to earn such an enviable  reputation. Unfortunately, the fact of the matter is, people who sell  for a living do so in an environment that is polluted by a few unscrupulous   but highly visible  individuals, who are more interested  in making a shortterm buck than they are in creating longterm profitable  relationships with their clients.

Even the most wellmeaning sales people lie on occasion, and when  they're caught as they almost invariably are, this only serves to  further poison their relationships with their customers  and  the selling environment for all of us.

Why sales people lie to their clients

There are three key reasons why salespeople lie to their clients

1. They don't know their product.

Some sales people lie by accident because they're unsure or uninformed  about the products they're selling. In many cases, they lie simply  because they're too embarrassed to say, I don't know.

2. They're too empathetic.

Some sales people lie because they're insecure about themselves,  or their relationship with their prospect. They just want the customer  to like them, so they stretch the truth to tell the customer what  they think they want to hear. Lying then becomes an inappropriate  vehicle to build a friend first, and a customer second.

3. They're only focused on the money.

Some sales people see lying as an easy way to make a quick buck.  Sales people who lie for this reason do it because they want the  prospect to move too quickly, so that they can make a quick sale,  pocket the commission  and move on to the next prospect before  the first customer can have any second thoughts.

Unfortunately, the vast majority of prospects out there weren't  born yesterday or on a turnip truck. 99 times out of 100, they've  encountered these lies before, and as a result, they've become conditioned  to expect a certain experience from the sales process. They assume  they know how a sales person will act, and they base their responses  on that assumption.

In fact, in many cases, prospects become so good at predicting  sales behaviors that they become experts at manipulating the sales  process to get exactly what they want  often at the expense  of the sales person.

Why clients lie to sales people

Of course, when it comes to sales, truth telling or the lack thereof!  works both ways.

One of the most common reasons prospects have for lying to sales  people is that they have been lied to by a sales person in the past,  and are only trying to give back a little of what they  have gotten.

They'll lie to avoid an annoying sales pitch. They'll lie  to protect themselves against overly persistent phone calls and email  followups, or to avoid being pressured into making a decision. They'll  lie to protect their reputations, their budgets, their time and their  jobs.

Most of all, they'll lie because they automatically assume all  sales people are liars, and they want to make a preemptive strike  before they are lied to first.

Think about how sales people are commonly portrayed in popular culture.  Movies like Tin Men, Planes, Trains and Automobiles, Tommy Boy  and Glengarry Glen Ross don't exactly paint a sterling portrait  of our profession. The result is that we who do want to excel legitimately  in our chosen profession have a pretty swift current to row against.

But while it may be difficult, it's not an impossible challenge.  Gaining the trust of your customers and prospects just takes a little  extra effort and forethought  as well as complete dedication  to honesty in how you conduct your business.

If my business is still growing, why should I care?

In my research over the past 20 years, I've found that only  10 of sales people in any organization are what we might call top  performers  those who regularly close at least half of  their qualified prospects. At the other end of the spectrum are another  20 comprised of under performers, as well as those who are new or  on their way out.

The remaining 70 of sales people fall into a broad category that  is best described as the average majority. To be fair,  being an average performer isn't a terrible thing  these  sales reps will close about one out of every three qualified prospects,  and make a decent living in the process.

But few sales professionals would ever choose to be average,  especially when the tools to become a top performer are so easily  within their grasp.

Just consider the missed opportunities! While they regularly hit  their average targets, these sales people are missing out on over  twothirds of the sales they could potentially close. This means that,  for every 300k in potential sales in your pipeline, you're leaving  a whopping 200k on the table  or to the competition.

The secret to sales success

Successful sales people all use a range of different styles and techniques,  but they also all share one key thing in common they know that honest  communication is the single most important secret to increasing sales,  and commissions.

By focusing their efforts on creating a positive customer experience  based on openness and trust, these top performers can almost always  rely on an extraordinary level of repeat sales. Nine times out of  ten, their customers would simply never even think of looking elsewhere  when they need to reorder. As we all know, it's far easier   and far more profitable  to keep repeat business than it is  to land a whole new account.

So what's the secret to establishing and maintaining  credibility in the eyes of your clients?

Don't lie. Ever. End of story.

Lies not only damage the ability of sales people to communicate with  their clients. They can also result in a complete communication breakdown  that is difficult  or even impossible  to repair.

Consider the consequences of this kind of breakdown in communication  and trust. According to Fred Reichheld, author of Loyalty  Rules, North American companies lose roughly half of their customers  every five years, half of their employees every four years, and half  of their investors in less than one year. In our view, most of these  staggering losses are caused by a breakdown of communication in one  of three primary areas

1. During the sales cycle with potential new prospects

2. Following unsatisfactory aftersales service or addon sales  between sales people and clients and

3. Among coworkers in unpleasant or stressful work environments.

In addition to the lost sales and revenues that these breakdowns  represent, there are also numerous hidden costs. Losing customers  to a misunderstanding or a lack of trust can dramatically reduce your  satisfaction in your work, as well as the satisfaction that your clients  have about you and your company's products or services.

Worse yet, it can permanently ruin your reputation  and your  ability to earn future business.
