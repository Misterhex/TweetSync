Really? Java developers love writing nonJava

What language do Java developers love to write in? The results of a survey of 100 Java developers may surprise you

Print 

I asked  and the people responded! Fun fact No. 1 Apparently only 28 percent of Java developers write Java full time.

My survey may not be a truly scientific poll, but I was able to grab a good sampling of folks in the Java group on Google along with people in my Twitter, LinkedIn, and Facebook networks. Many of those folks in turn retweeted and reposted, so I actually know a only few of the people who responded. Throwing out duplicates and errors didnt significantly affect the results.
