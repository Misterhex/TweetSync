>I think that theres a lot of institutional knowledge in our field, especially about what makes for a productive engineer. But while there are a good deal of books in the management field about expert roles and responsibilities of nontechnical individual contributors, I dont see too many modern books or posts that might shed light directly on what makes for a good senior engineer. One notable exception is of course Kate Matsudaira , who has been posting quite a good deal recently about the cultural sides of engineering .
>
>Yet at the same time, a good lot of successful engineers whom I have known all remember the mentor who taught them what it meant to be senior.
>
>I do, however, agree 100 with my friend Theos words about being senior in his chapter of the Web Operations book by OReilly
>
>Generation X and even more so generation Y are cultures of immediate gratification. Ive worked with a staggering number of engineers that expect the career path to take them to the highest ranks of the engineering group inside 5 years just because they are smart. This is simply impossible in the staggering numbers Ive witnessed. Not everyone can be senior. If, after five years, you are senior, are you at the peak of your game? After five more years will you not have accrued more invaluable experience? What then? Super engineer? Five more years? Superduper engineer. I blame the youth of our discipline for this affliction. The truth is that there are very few engineers that have been in the field of web operations for fifteen years. Given the dynamics of our industry many elected to move on to managerial positions or risk an entrepreneurial run at things.
>
>Hes right this field of web operations is still quite young. So we cant be surprised when people who have a title of senior exhibit unsurprisingly immature behavior, both technical and nontechnical. If you havent read Theos chapter, I suggest you do.
>
>Having said that, what does it actually mean to be senior in this discipline? I certainly have an opinion of what it means, given that Im charged with hiring, supporting, and retaining engineers whom are deemed to be senior. This notion that there is a bar to be passed in terms of career development is a good one, but Id also add that these criteria exist on a spectrum, as opposed to a simple list of checkboxes. You dont wake up one day and you are senior just because your title reflects that upon a promotion. Senior engineers dont know everything. Theyre not perfect in their technical knowledge, and theyre OK with that.
>
>In order not to confuse titles with expectations that are fuzzy, sometimes Ill refer to engineering maturity.
>
>Meaning I expect a senior engineer to be a mature engineer.
>
>Im going to gloss over the part where one could simply list the technical areas in which a mature engineer should have some level of mastery or understanding such as Networking, Filesystems, Algorithms, etc. and instead highlight the personal characteristics that in my mind give me indication that someone can influence an organization or a business positively in the domain of engineering.
>
>Over on Quora, someone once asked me What are the attributes other than technical abilityexperience that makes a great VP of Technical Operations? . The list of attributes that I mentioned in the answer came with the understanding that they are perpetual aspirations of my own. This post is similar to that answer.
>
>I might first argue that senior engineers in web development and operations have the same characteristics as senior engineers in other fields of engineering mechanical, electrical, chemical, etc. in which case The Unwritten Laws of Engineering are applicable. Again, if you havent read this, please go do so. It was originally written in 1944, published by the American Society of Mechanical Engineers . A good excerpt from the book is here .
>
>While the books structure and prose still has a dated feel refrain from using profanity in the workplace or men should pay particular attention to shaving habits and the trimming of beards and mustaches, it gives a good outline of the nontechnical expectations, responsibilities, and inner workings of an engineering organization with respect to how both managers and mature engineers might behave.
>
>Obligatory Pithy Characteristics of Mature Engineers
>
>All posts that attempt to give insight to aspirational characteristics must have an overabundance of bullet points, and the field of engineering has a fair share of them. Therefore, Im going to give you some, some mine and some pulled from various sources, many from the Unwritten Laws mentioned above.

>Mature engineers seek out constructive criticism of their designs.

>Every successful engineer Ive met, upon finishing up a design or getting ready for a project, will continually ask their peers questions along the lines of
>
>What could I be missing?
>
>How will this not work?
>
>Will you please shoot as many holes as possible into my thinking on this?
>
>Even if its technically sound, is it understandable enough for the rest of the organization to operate, troubleshoot, and extend it?
>
>This is because they know that nothing they make will ever only be in their hands, and that good peer review is what makes better design decisions. As its been said elsewhere, they beg for the bad news.
>
>Mature engineers understand the nontechnical areas of how they are perceived.
>
>Being able to write a Bloom Filter in Erlang, or write multithreaded C in your sleep is insufficient. None of that matters if no one wants to work with you. Mature engineers know that no matter how complete, elegant, or superior their designs are, it wont matter if no one wants to work alongside them because they are assholes . Condescension, belittling, narcissism, and egoboosting behavior send the message to other engineers maybe tacitly to stay away. Part of being happy in engineering comes from enjoying the company of the people you work with while designing and building things. An engineer who is quick to call someone a moron is someone destined to stunt his or her career.
>
>This also means that mature engineers have selfawareness when it comes to their communication. This isnt to say that every mature engineer communicates perfectly, only that they have some notion about where they could be better, and continually ask for a gutcheck from peers and managers on how theyre doing. They aim to be assertive, not passive or aggressive in how they get their ideas across.
>
>Ive mentioned it elsewhere , but I must emphasize the point more the degree to which other people want to work with you is a direct indication on how successful youll be in your career as an engineer. Be the engineer that everyone wants to work with.
>
>Now this isnt to say that you should shy away from giving or getting constructive criticism on the work produced by engineering as opposed to the engineer personally, for fear of pissing someone off. Theres a difference between calling someone a moron and pointing out faults in their code or product. In a conversation with Theo, he pointed out another possible area where our field may grow up
>
>We as an industry need to of course refrain from critiques of human character and condition, but not shy away from critiques of work product. We need to get tougher skin and be able to receive critique through a lens that attempts to eliminate personal focus.
>
>There will be assholes, they should be shunned. But the attitude that someones code is their baby should come to an end. Code doesnt have feelings, doesnt develop complexes and certainly doesnt exhibit the most important trait the ability to reproduce of that which carries for your genetic strains.
>
>See also below 2 and 10 in The Ten Commandments of Egoless Programming.
>
>I think this has a corollary from the Unwritten Laws emphasis mine
>
>Be careful about whom you mark for copies of letters, memos, etc., when the interests of other departments are involved.
>
>A lot of mischief has been caused by young people broadcasting memorandum containing damaging or embarrassing statements. Of course it is sometimes difficult for a novice to recognize the dynamite in such a document but, in general, it is apt to cause trouble if it steps too heavily upon someones toes or reveals a serious shortcoming on anybodys part. If it has wide distribution or if it concerns manufacturing or customer difficulties, youd better get the boss to approve it before it goes out unless youre very sure of your ground.
>
>This of course underscores the dated feel of the book, but in the modern era, I still believe the main point to be true. Nothing indicates that you have a lack of perspective and awareness like a poorly thought out and nonconstructive tweet that slings venomous insults. Its a junior engineer mistake to toss insults about a piece of complex technology in 140 characters.
>
>I certainly  much like Christopher Brown mentioned in his keynote at Velocity London  pay attention to those sorts of public remarks when I come across them so that I can note who I would reconsider hiring if they ever applied to work at Etsy.
>
>Mature engineers do not shy away from making estimates, and are always trying to get better at it.
>
>From the Unwritten Laws
>
>Promises, schedules, and estimates are necessary and important instruments in a wellordered business. Many engineers fail to realize this, or habitually try to dodge the irksome responsibility for making commitments. You must make promises based upon your own estimates for the part of the job for which you are responsible, together with estimates obtained from contributing departments for their parts. No one should be allowed to avoid the issue by the old formula, I cant give a promise because it depends upon so many uncertain factors.
>
>Avoiding responsibility for estimates is another way of saying, Im not ready to be relied upon for building critical pieces of infrastructure. All businesses rely on estimates, and all engineers working on a project are involved in Joint Activity , which means that they have a responsibility to others to make themselves interpredictable. In general, mature engineers are comfortable with working within some nonzero amount of uncertainty and risk.
>
>Mature engineers have an innate sense of anticipation, even if they dont know they do.
>
>This code looks good, Im proud of myself. Ive asked other people to review it, and Ive taken their feedback. Now how long will it last before its rewritten? Once its in production, how will its execution affect resource usage? How much so I expect CPUmemorydisknetwork to increase or decrease? Will others be able to understand this code? Am I making it as easy as I can for others to extend or introspect this work?
>
>Mature engineers understand that not all of their projects are filled with rockstaronstage work.
>
>However menial and trivial your early assignments may appear, give them your best effort.
>
>Getting things done means doing things you might not be interested in. No matter how sexy a project is, there are always boring tasks. Tedious tasks. Tasks that a less mature engineer may deem beneath their dignity or their job title. My good friend Kellan ElliotMcCrea Etsys CTO had this to say about it
>
>Sometimes the saving grace of a tedious task is their simplicity and maturity manifests in finishing them quickly and moving on.  Sometimes tasks are tedious because they require extreme discipline and malleable attention span.  Its an odd phenomena that the most tedious tasks, only to be carried out by the most senior engineers, can also be the most terrifying.
>
>Mature engineers lift the skills and expertise of those around them.
>
>They recognize that at some point, their individual contribution and potential cannot be exercised singularly. They recognize that there is only so much that can be produced by a single person, and the worlds best engineering feats are executed by teams, not singularly brilliant and lone engineers. Tom Limoncelli makes this point quite well in his post .
>
>At Etsy we call this a generosity of spirit. Generosity of spirit is one of our core engineering values, but also a primary responsibility of our Staff Engineer position, a careerlevel position. These engineers spend the time to make sure that more junior or new engineers unfamiliar with the tech or processes we have not only understand what they are doing, but also why they are doing it. Teaching to fish is a mandatory skill at this level, and that requires having both patience and a perspective of investment in the rest of the organization.
>
>Therefore instead of OK, move over, lemme just do it for you, its instead Ok, lets work on this together. I can show you how Im writingtroubleshootingetc. Then, you do it so I can be sure you know whyhow were doing it this way, etc.
>
>Related see below about getting credit.
>
>Mature engineers make their tradeoffs explicit when making judgements and decisions.
>
>They realize all engineering decisions, implementations, and designs exist within a spectrum we do not live in a binary world. They can quickly point out contexts where one successful approach or solution could work and where it could not. They know that one cannot be both efficient and thorough at the same time  The ETTO Principle , that most projects engineers work on exist on an axis of optimality and brittleness, and that whether the problems they are solving are acute or chronic.
>
>They know that they work within a spectrum of ideal and nonideal, and are OK with that. They are comfortable with it because they strive to make the ideal and nonideal in a design explicit. Later on in the lifecycle of a design, when the original design is not scaling anymore or needs to be replaced or rewritten, they can look back not with a perspective of how shortsighted those earlier decisions were, but instead say yep, we made it this far with it and knew wed have to extend or change it at some point. Looks like that time is now, lets get to work! instead of responding with a crankypants, passiveaggressive Hindsight Biasfilled remark with counterfactuals e.g.. those idiots didnt do it right the first time!, they cut corners!, I TOLD them this wouldnt work!
>
>Many pithy quotes exist that shine light on this notion of tradeoffs, and mature engineers know that there are limits to any philosophyladen quotes including the ones Im writing here
>
>Premature optimization is the root of all evil.  a very abused maxim, and Ive written about it before . A corollary to that might be taken from here  Understanding what is and isnt premature is what separates senior engineers from junior engineers.
>
>Right tool for the job  another abused one. The intention here is reasonable who wants to use a tool that isnt appropriate? But a rare perspective is that this can be detrimental when taken to the extreme. A carpenter doesnt arm himself with every variation and size of hammer that is available, even thought he may encounter hammering tasks that could be ideally handled by each one. Why? Because lugging around and maintaining a gazillion hammers incurs a cost. As such, decisions on this axis have tradeoffs.
>
>The tldr on tradeoffs is that everyone cuts corners, in every project. Immature engineers discover them in hindsight, disgusted. Mature engineers spell them out at the onset of a project, accept them and recognize them as part of good engineering.
