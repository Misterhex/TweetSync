>1 Year of Experience Repeated 20 Times
>
>I cant find the original quote, but when I googled the gist of it I found this wording
>
>What is often mistaken for 20 years experience, is just 1 years experience repeated 20 times
>
>Being on tour can be like that, too. Youre just moving from city to city, repeating the same show over and over. Time passes by but you dont feel like youre really growing.
>
>I havent been on any long tours lately, which is great because I have so much to work on right now. And this down time is actually the real busy time for me.
>
>Playing 20 different shows with different bands and different music is much harder than playing the same set with the same band 20 nights in a row!
>
>Sometimes being on tour feels like youve pressed the pause button.
>
>How do you avoid that repetition of 1 years experience over 20 years?
>
>Do things that challenge you. Whenever a gig or recording session gives me anxiety and I start worrying about how Im going to do itor if I can do it!I know that Id better say yes. Its no fun if every single gig is high pressure and anxietymaking, the same way as its no fun if every gig is really comfortable and easy. You need to work in the learning zone at least some of the time.

>Work hard. Do I really need to expand on that?
>
>Make lots of mistakes. Hide them well, if you can, but make them. Mistakes  experience. Lots of mistakes  lots of experience!
