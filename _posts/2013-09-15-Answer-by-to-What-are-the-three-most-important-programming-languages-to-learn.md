I would focus on learning three classes of languages to really understand the nature of programming and to have a decent toolkit. Everything else is basically variants on that.

Learn a lowlevel language so you understand what goes on at the bare metal and so you can make hardware dance

The obvious choice here is C, but assembly language might also be good.

Learn a language for architecting large systems

If you want to build large code bases, you're going to need one of the strongly typed languages. Personally, I think Java is the best choice here but C, Scala and even Ada are acceptable.

Learn a language for scripting things together quickly

There are a few choices here shell, Python, Perl, Lua. Any of these will do, but Python is probably the foremost. These are great for gluing existing pieces together.

Now, if you only get three, that's it. But I'm going to suggest two more categories.

Learn a language that forces you to think differently about programming

These are majorly different world perspectives. Examples here would be functional programming, like Haskell, ML, etc, but also logic programming like Prolog.

Learn a language that lets you build webbased applications quickly

This could be web2py or Javascript  but the ability to quickly hack together a web demo is really useful today.
