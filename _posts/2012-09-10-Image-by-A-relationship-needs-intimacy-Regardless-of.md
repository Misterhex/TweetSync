>A relationship needs intimacy. Regardless of whether its a physical intimacy or an emotional intimacy, your relationship will slowly wither and die without it. This is where it gets tricky. Because your relationship actually needs both types of intimacy.
>
>You cannot create a physical intimacy without the emotional intimacy, nor can you have complete emotional intimacy without the physical aspect as well. This is where many couples find their relationship in trouble.
>
>Its very common for one type of intimacy to be more important to one partner than the other, then they both find themselves going along thinking everything is fine until their partner finally speaks up and lets them know that the intimacy levels are not what they should be. Or, even more tragic, is when neither partner says anything and they find themselves ending the relationship without really knowing why.
>
>If you cant be intimate with your partner, whether physically or emotionally or both, you cannot expect to having a lasting relationship with your partner. The reason for this is quite simple. Without the emotional and physical bond between mates, theres nothing to hold onto when things get rough and both partners find themselves feeling as though theyve got no anchor to keep them safe in the rocky ocean of life.
>
>Human beings require intimacy. This is why simple physical affections such as handholding, cuddling, hugs and kisses are important to your relationship. These simple actions let you and your partner know that youre there for one another, that you matter to the other.
>
>If you know you can give your partner a look from across the room, and that he or she will return that special wink or smile, then youve developed an intimacy in your relationship.
>
>Your relationship cannot survive without intimacy, because intimacy is the foundation of any relationship. Perhaps thats not quite accurate, intimacy is what helps love to survive through the toughest of times, and makes us continue to want to love and be loved by our partners.
>
>Intimacy helps both partners to know that they are loved, that love is worth it. The need to be as close as possible emotionally, to the one person weve promised to spend the rest of our lives with is important to fulfill.
>
>Without intimacy, the outlook for a lifelong relationship with a partner is pretty dim and quite frankly, completely unappealing.
>
>Most couples have developed an intimacy by the time they actually commit to a longterm relationship or marry, but what most dont realize is that its essential to your relationship to continue to build that intimacy. Everyone wants to be accepted and loved for who they are, regardless of what they might do.
>
>Most dont intend to hurt their significant other and most dont want to doubt their partner. Without intimacy, there is never the security in the relationship of knowing that the other person is there for you, or of knowing that they truly love you. This is why a relationship without intimacy on both levels is pretty much doomed to failure.
>
>Sure, a relationship can survive without intimacy but it will become a real struggle for both partners as time goes on. When a relationship is struggling due to a lack of intimacy, neither partner will be happy or feel secure in the relationship. Without happiness and security, the vicious cycle continues.
>
>Because of one simple fact No one wants to even attempt to be intimate on a physical or emotional level with a person they are unhappy with.
>
>Once intimacy is lost or if it never existed in the relationship, it takes a lot of determination and commitment to get intimacy back in the relationship. But its not impossible.
>
>After all, intimacy in a relationship is what humanbeings crave, its a basic need that must be met for any relationship to succeed. Even animals recognize this.
