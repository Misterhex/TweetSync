The Art of Product Management
This is a follow up to Do Product Managers really need a background in CS?
Have you ever used “ Let me Google that for you ”? It’s a silly way to point out to people that they could have figured out the answer to the question they asked you on their own.
It’s pretty frustrating to have someone else waste your time when they could have found the answer on their own. Yet PMs do this to their engineers when they draw some arbitrary line on what they’re willing to learn.
This brings us to the 3rd mistake than non-technical PMs make: wasting engineers’ time on things you could do yourself. If you find that your teammates seem frustrated to answer your questions or ignore your requests, look into whether you can do those things yourself.
One great place to start is analyzing data. Learn what your product logs and how to access those logs.  You might need to learn how to write SQL commands.  Spend a day and learn SQL.  The time investment is worth it because you’ll save the engineers time, context switching, and frustration.  Plus, when you can see the answers to your data questions quickly you’ll be able to iterate on those questions and dig deeper to find better insights.
Another area to consider is reading simple things in the code. If you spend a few hours learning how to search through your team’s code base, you can answer all kinds of questions on your own. Many teams have files that are very useful for a PM to know about like a list of blacklisted words or the names of all the running experiments.
If you manage those, you can even advance to checking in simple code changes, like correcting typos in the UI. It’s not always more efficient to make the changes yourself, but during crunch-time it’s a way to help out your team that they’ll really appreciate.
The key to improving is to switch from asking “Can you do this for me?” to “Can you teach me how to do this?”. Most engineers would be happy to take some extra time to teach you how to answer questions on your own.  You’ll become more self sufficient and your engineers will have more time to work on the product.
