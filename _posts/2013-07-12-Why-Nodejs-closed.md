I don't fully get what Node.js is all about. Maybe it's because I am mainly a web based business application developer. What is it and what is the use of it?
My understanding so far is that:
The programming model is event driven, especially the way it handles I/O .
It uses JavaScript and the parser is V8 .
It can be easily used to create concurrent server applications.
Are my understandings correct? If yes, then what are the benefits of evented I/O, is it just more for the concurrency stuff? Also, is the direction of Node.js to become a framework like, JavaScript based (V8 based) programming model?
