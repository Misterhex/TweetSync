The Top 10 Programming Languages For Techies only

Tech Impulsion   Feb 2012   Ajit Singh

Posted on 05052012 102541 AM PDT by SeekAndFind

The knowledge of a handful of programming languages could come to be a lifesaver to many a programmer, especially since most languages that were popular 10 years ago are not as viable as they are now.

But there are many developers who have earned their worth simply by knowing the right programming language at the right time, simply because they had solid skills that were profitable while the language was popular.

Here are some languages though, which stayed popular through the years, and prove to give young developers a jumpstart to their careers , and always are a bonus to add to any developers resume, as compiled by TIOBE software , a coding standards company.

1. Java

What is it?

An objectoriented programming language developed in the late 1990s by James Gosling and colleagues at Sun Microsystems.

Why is it important?

This beautiful programming language is central for any nonMicrosoft developer, i.e. any developer who focuses on the non.NET experience. It is mostly derived from C and C but has a more basic object model. It ranked first on TIOBEs list of most popular programming languages.

2. C

What is it?

C, a general purpose programming language built by Dennis Ritchie when he was a part of Bell Telephone labs, is the bass of C and other programming languages. It was built to work with the Unix operating system.

Why is it important?

C is one of the most widely used programming languages of all time, and ranked second on the list. Learning C is crucial. Once you learn C, making the jump to Java or C is fairly easy, because a lot of the syntax is common. Also, a lot of C syntax is used in scripting languages, Wayne Duqaine, director of Software Development at Grandview Systems, of Sebastopol, Calif., told eWEEK.



3. C

What is it?

This generalpurpose programming language developed by Microsoft evolved from C and C as a part of the software companys .NET initiative.

Why is it important?

This language is an essential part of the .NET framework, so developers who use Microsoft heavily will find it critical, according to Duqaine.

4. C

What is it?

C is a general purpose multiparadigm spanning compiled language that has both highlevel and lowlevel languages features. It was started as an enhancement to the C programming language, Bjarne Stroustrup in 1979.

Why is it important?

It is one of the most popular programming languages, winning fourth place on the list, with application domains including systems software, application software, server and client applications, and entertainment software such as video games. The language has also greatly influenced many other popular programming languages, such as C and Java.

5. ObjectiveC



What is it?

This objectoriented programming language created first by Brad Cox and Tom Love at their company Stepstone in the early 1980s, adds Smalltalklike messaging to the C programming language.

Why is it important?

This language is most used on the Apple iOS and Mac OS X. ObjectiveC is the principal language used for Apple's Cocoa API as well.

6. PHP

What is it?

This language is especially suited for Web development because of it easy embedding into HTML pages. It is an opensource, serverside, crossplatform, interpretive HTML scripting language

Why is it important?

It is a popular language, ranking sixth on TIOBEs list. Highspeed scripting with caching, augmented with compiled code plugins such as can be done with Perl and PHP is where the future is. Building Web apps from scratch using C or COBOL is going the way of the dinosaur, said Duquaine, according to eWEEKs report.

7. Visual Basic

This is an eventdriven programming language which is implemented on Microsofts .Net framework.

Why is it important?

This language ranked as the seventh most popular language on TIOBEs list, probably because it was designed by Microsoft to be easy to learn and use. According to Tim Huckaby, CEO of San Diegobased software engineering company CEO Interknowlogy.com, It is currently dominating in adoption and that is where all the work is, as in eWEEKs report.

8. Python

What is it?

This is an eventdriven programming language which is extensively used by Google because of its simplicity. It is managed by the Python Software Foundation.

Why is it important?

Pythonis ageneralpurpose,highlevel programming language whose design philosophy emphasizes codereadability. Python claims to combine remarkable power with very clear syntax, andits standard libraryis large and comprehensive.

It is releases on 4 September 2011, 6 months ago.It is developed by Python Software Foundation.

9. Perl

What is it?

Being a highlevel programming language, its emphasis lies in code readability and clear syntax. It combines Objectoriented and functional programming styles, and is often used as a scripting language. Perl is an opensource language used widely to process text through CGI programs.

Why is it important?

Perls efficiency in processing of piles of text has ranked it ninth in terms of programming language popularity. It is used extensively to write Web server programs for a variety of tasks. Learning some form of scripting language, such as Perl or PHP is critical if you are doing Web apps, told Wayne Duqaine, director of Software Development at Grandview Systems, of Sebastopol, Calif., in a talk with eWEEK.

10. JavaScript

What is it?

JavaScript is an objectoriented scripting language that is smaller than Java. Being a clientside language, it runs in the web browser on the clientside with a simplified set of commands, easier code and no need for compilation.

Why is it important?

JavaScript is simple to learn and is the tenth most widely used programming language. It is used in millions of web pages to authenticate forms, detect browsers and improve design, and it is easier to run these functions as it is embedded into HTML.

RE What? No ADA??

Ada is definitely still being used in a number of niche markets, but it isnt popular for mainstream commercial development. But then again, Ada wasnt designed to be C or Java, it was designed to meet a number of requirements for DoD systems, and these requirements also align with those for heavy industry, safetycritical systems, verifiable systems, and so on, and thats where you find Ada today.

Some factoid for those interested...

Oracles PLSQL language is based on Ada, the syntax, structure the concepts of records, packages and exceptions are all taken from Ada.

There are a lot of people using PLSQL, I think they just stay quiet because its so dull.

Building Web apps from scratch using C or COBOL...

There it is. Using COBOL never would have occurred to me for web pages. HTML and xHTMLCSS were enough.

I used to know quite a bit of that stuff. And back when my ISP had Unix shell accounts, I used to play around with that stuff and the vi editor, too.

But now I'm an Algebra teacher and I don't have anything to program that would allow me to practice any of that stuff. Oh, well.

This article is slanted towards Application development and Web programming. Lots of Systems administrators are using Perl and other scripting languages to solve problems every day.

In fact on Dice the number of Jobs for Per greatly exceeds PHP or Python.

That is a fascinating graphic, but it greatly misses the boat on job postings. Craigslist is a darn poor job site. The stats should be from Dice and MonsterCareerBuilder.

Craigslist is for jobs for which the employer HR department has no budget. Heck, even the local newspaper is more worthwhile, in my experience.

My company is building a business out of converting COBOL programs to C. There is still a lot of need for COBOL programmers.

Also, just looking at job postings is not quite enough. In order to manage the programming environments, one needs a working knowledge of scripting languages and shells. We just held an inhouse training session on expect to support the development of test programs.

COBOL, FORTRAN, PL1, ASM, APL, SQL, JCL, Nomad2, Focus. The dead languages? APL even had its own character set and required a special keyboard.

As a follow up to my prior post, that is also why open source so dominates Craigslist job postings. Microsoft barely registers on that Craigslist stat. It makes the result completely bogus.

Oldie but still a goodie...

Jack was a COBOL programmer in the mid to late 1990s. After years of being taken for granted and treated as a technological dinosaur by all the ClientServer programmers, PC repair technicians and website developers, he was finally getting some respect. Hed become a private consultant specializing in Year 2000 conversions.

Several years of this relentless, mindnumbing work had taken its toll on Jack. He began having anxiety dreams about the Year 2000. All he could think about was how he could avoid the year 2000 and all that came with it.

Jack decided to contact a company that specialized in cryogenics. He made a deal to have himself frozen until March 15th, 2000. The next thing he would know is hed wake up in the year 2000 after the New Year celebrations and computer debacles after the leap day. Nothing else to worry about except getting on with his life.

He was put into his cryogenic receptacle, the technicians set the revive date, he was given injections to slow his heartbeat to a bare minimum, and that was that.

The next thing that Jack saw was an enormous and very modern room filled with excited people. They were all shouting I cant believe it! and Its a miracle and Hes alive!. There were cameras unlike any hed ever seen and equipment that looked like it came out of a science fiction movie.

Someone who was obviously a spokesperson for the group stepped forward. Jack couldnt contain his enthusiasm. Is it over? he asked. Is the year 2000 already here? Are all the millennial parties and promotions and crises all over and done with?

The spokesman explained that there had been a problem with the programming of the timer on Jacks cryogenic receptacle, it hadnt been year 2000 compliant. It was actually eight thousand years later, not the year 2000. Technology had advanced to such a degree that everyone had virtual reality interfaces which allowed them to contact anyone else on the planet.

That sounds terrific, said Jack. But Im curious. Why is everybody so interested in me?

Well, said the spokesman. The year 10000 is just around the corner, and it says in your files that you know COBOL.

LOL! On that note, I dredged up some knowledge from 30 years ago last time I touched the stuff on 74xx chips and gate logic to solve an oddball custom videogame controller problem my son threw at me. He screws around with oldschool stand up console fighting games like Tekken and Marvel vs. Capcom.

If a programmer doesnt know c, theyre not a programmer.

And what the hell does this mean? ...since most languages that were popular 10 years ago are not as viable as they are now.

I remember in college taking a course that touched on several languages at once. Snobol?

Objective C has no place on this list. Its not a language at all. It is simply a precompiler for C. Its kludgy and stupid. I dont like the stupid  crap.

RE If a programmer doesnt know c, theyre not a programmer.

No, not at all. It simply tells us that in a job market like the one we have now, employers want someone who can do the job NOW. Theyre not going to invest the time for someone to learn a programming language on the job.

You might be an excellent Assembly language programmer, but if the market for Assembly programmers are few  i.e., not in demand, which is the case today, and I suspect, in future , you are unlikely to find a job and would be better off targetting those companies that still have need for this specific skill.

I rememeber in the 1990s there was humongous need for developers with POWERBUILDER skills. Now, I see little or no advertisement for this skill at all.

Google uses PHP ??

According to Steve Yegge, who works there, Google has four corporatewide standard languages , and PHP is not among them

One of the hundreds of cool things about working for Google is that they let teams experiment, as long as it's done within certain broad and welldefined boundaries. One of the fences in this big playground is your choice of programming language. You have to play inside the fence defined by C, Java, Python, and JavaScript.

MapReduce a Google invention programmed in PHP? Not so. You may be able to use MapReduce or workalikes from PHP, but MapReduce is not written in PHP.

I usemaintain Java, C and Perl code on a daily basis. I guess my skills are still up to date. If you can take the punishment learning PERL you will be handsomely rewarded as it is to me the most useful thing in the world. I can do things with PERL regex hashes on one line that would take 10 to 100s of lines of c or java code.
