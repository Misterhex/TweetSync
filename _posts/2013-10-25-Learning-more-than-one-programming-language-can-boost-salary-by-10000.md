The majority of IT professionals believe knowing more than one programming language is an essential skill to have in the current IT recruitment market, according to a report by IT recruiter Greythorn.

Furthermore, the firms research suggests that learning more than one programming language can increase your salary by between 3,000 and 10,000 per annum.

The recruitment company says employers, many of them in London, are looking for flexible IT staff that have knowledge of three or four different programming languages. An added bonus would be candidates that have a mix of both traditional and niche programming expertise.

Charlie Setoodeh, senior consultant at Greythorn, said the explosion of programming languages, such as Scala, Perl and Ruby has changed the landscape for IT professionals When building up your skillset as an IT professional, its now a major sellingpoint to have expertise in multiple languages.

But according to Setoodeh, candidates with a broad expertise are few and far between. Where new languages create cost savings or greater utility for employers, demand can spring up almost overnight for people who can use it, he said. 

The most lucrative and indemand languages are Scala, Python, Erlang, Ruby on Rails and Perl, according to Greythorn. The fastest growing programming language, due to a need for more developers able to work on mobile platforms, is Objective C, according to the TIOBE software index .

However the TIOBE index did not show a correlation between the most popular programming languages and higher salaries. The index found the most popular programming languages in March 2012 in terms of the number of lines of code written were Java, C and C. However the salary increase for knowledge of these programmes was less than 500.

Anthony Koporo, consultant at Greythorn, said IT professionals should take care to access languages that are currently in high demand When you look at TIOBEs index, perennials such as Java might seem the obvious choices for professionals looking to expand their expertise. But Java use is shrinking.

Professionals who focus on the fastestgrowing languages will see the best rewards, because there are fewer professionals out there with the expertise to do the job. Thats why people who can use Objective C and Python currently stand out from the crowd.

Koporo said the only exception to this rule is contract work, as this type of employment tends to focus on projects that use only one programming language. He pointed out that there is less advantage in knowing multiple languages when applying for these types of roles.
