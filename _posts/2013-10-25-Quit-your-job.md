So, You Want To Quit Your Job? Why You Should

10.22.2013

 More

This is the first in a series of posts Ill be writing about quitting your job.

Many software developers Ive talked to have expressed interest in the idea of someday either starting their own business, or in some capacity working for themselves.

I think this is a great ideaand Im all for itbut, before you do really quit your job, you should first understand why it is a good idea to quit your job, beyond just not wanting to work for someone else. You should also have a good idea of what working for yourself is really likeso you know what you are getting into. And finally, you should be equipped with some knowledge of how to be successful at itso you can actually survive and not have to come crawling back to the corporate world begging forgiveness.

Now, Im not an expert on the subject myself having just officially become free near the beginning of this year but, Ill share with you what I have learned along the way, both my successes and failures.

Why you should do it

In this first post Ill be talking about why I think it is a good idea to aspire leave the employ of another and work for yourselfwhy you should quit your job.

When it comes to quitting your job, there is one reason, above all others, I think is the most important. That reason is that when you are working for someone else you are not building anything for you future.

What do I mean by this?

What I mean, is that when you are working a job where you are getting paid to do that job, in most cases you are trading time and effort for money. You are devoting the time and effort and you are being paid in cash that is the limit of the transaction.

On the other hand, when you are working for yourself you are building an asset. When you are working under your own employ you are trading time and effort for something far greater than money. You are converting your time and effort into an asset, which itself has value and hopefully can generate income all on its very own.

Think of it as the difference between feeding a man a fish and teaching a man to fish. Most of us are familiar with that particular phrase, but somehow we fail to see that it is us at the market each day buying a fish with our time and effort instead of learning to fish for ourselves.

It doesnt really matter if you are building your own freelancing business, authoring a book or some other content, building the next big startup, or just opening up an online store in every scenario where you arent working for someone else you are building an asset. The asset may be a tangible product that you will sell, but it also may be a list of clients or a reputation that you can lean on or cash in on later.

A great example of this is this very blog. Every post I write for this blog is building on this asset. It may not seem like much, it certainly didnt at first, but this blog has a dollar value that increases when I put more effort and time into it and it has the ability to generate income for me, be it through advertising, selling a product or just getting freelance work.

Anyone can do it

It doesnt really matter who you are, you can become selfemployed if you so desire. If you have a job right now it means that someone is willing to trade money for the asset you are helping them build. It means that you possess some skills that are able to build or contribute to the building of an asset.

Now perhaps you dont have the ability to realize the full potential of those abilities yourself, because your means are limited or you dont have the market to sell your skills into, but it doesnt mean you cant do it eventually if you are willing to put forth the effort to figure out how.

For a long time I was constrained by my own inability to see this truth. I always had the dream of working for myself, but the only ways I could  see it happening were if I were to somehow land some big government  contract or grant, or I started sourcing and selling products on Ebay.

Looking backwards now, with the blinders removed, I can see that there was opportunity at every corner. I can see now that at any point in time, I could have grabbed a pen or  more aptly a keyboard and started created value out of thin air.

The truth of the matter is that we all have an innate ability within us to create value out of nothing. There are so many forms this value can take. Here is just a short list
