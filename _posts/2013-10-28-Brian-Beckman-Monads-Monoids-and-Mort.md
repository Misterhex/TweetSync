Brian Beckman is a fascinating individual. Excosmologist, exmilitary operating system and simulation developer have you ever considered processes that move both forward and backward in time? Well, Brian and team at JPL created just that. He explains  in this interview....Brian was one of the first members of Microsoft Research and one of a group of physicists who joined Microsoft in the early 90s. At Microsoft he is a passionate advocate for Mort, the somewhat ambiguous class name for novice developers.  In fact, he considers himself a mort somewhat hard to believe, honestly, but we'll go along with it.... His team works on innovative incubation projects that turn into developer platform features like LINQ, for example and more. Tune into this very interesting  interview.

At 2700 into the interview, Mr. Beckman says

We want to turn Visual Basic into not only the best and most popular programming language in the world but the most advanced programming language in the world.

Wow! What an incredible statement. It even took Charles by surprise. Microsoft Research favoring VB over C! That's got to turn the .NET programming community on its ear.

right, there are not such thing as the best programming language! Microsoft Researchguys should know this better that anyone, advanced... would be nice to explain how... and sience CVB share same runtime how VB can be more advanced than C ?

Want to bet Carl Franklin will get an audio clipof this and air it on his next show on .NET Rocks?

I recommend both C, VB.NET, JavaScript, and TSQL if you are looking for a .NET position. I will be trying Ruby soon as well.

I'm trying to figure out how to spell the name of the programming Brian keeps mentionning, Askel, askl... What's the correct name?

Thanks Charles, what a great interview again!. Boy, some people at Microsoft makes me feel so clueless! And that Timewarp OS stuff is one of the craziest thing I hear about.

PS answering my own post Haskell

Glad you liked the conversation. I know I did!

Great video. Very interesting. Bit sad c will not get some of these features. Please add the links to blogs and so forth. Thanks!

C 3.0 also targets the same runtime but is more advanced than C 2.0. You can do a lot justby improving the compiler alone. So if more effort is put in the VB compiler in the futureit will get more advanced than C, although both target the same runtime.

At 0720 in do we have the first product placement on Channel9?

yes, I know we see products on it all the time, but I mean the way he reaches for the can is like they would do product placement on network TV

I really liked this interview. The guy is awesome and his stories too. Wargames on a Timewarp OS, drop everything and focus on Kuwait, and the story about the credit card id's used to track customers and the demise of a superior security system to a  focused economic interest were all just great pearls and there were many many more.

Why can't we use Timewarp simulations to help feed the hungry with the surplus of food that the developed world has, or to better optimize the resources that we have, why do we spend zillions in simulating war insted of simulating stuff that can help our ailing  planet to cope with the 6 billion people that live on it? Wouldn't have that been a great idea for the ImagineCup...

Kudos Charles!

Adding late binding to C could be done easily if they copied Boo. In Boo you can declare a variable as duck. Then any references to members on that variable are latebound. I like the approach because it makes the declaration explicit.

Where it gets more awesome is if you implement the IQuackFu interface on a class. This interface defines three methods QuackInvoke, QuackGet and QuackSet. So when calling code invokes anymember on your class, the compiler actually makes it call the dispatcher  methods of the interface, passing the member name and arguments.

This basically means you can do funky stuff like add methods at runtime to a class. See httpdocs.codehaus.orgpagesviewpage.action?pageId13653 for a cool dynamic mixin example.

That's interesting similar to System.Object approach. Anyway i like C how it isTODAY clean, elegant, some dynamic features whould'tbe bad,obviously depends on what they add. I'm looking at VB 9 specifications and i can't say the same, too many new constructs  very ugly, they extend it too fast.

The next time you interview one of these 'Physics Mafia' guys, I'd be interested in knowing their answer to the following question What is one Megabyte?

If they answer 106 or 1,000,000 they are correct.

If they answer 220 or 1,048,576 which is what the dir command thinks it is I would be greatly saddened.

TommyCarlier Widen yourgaze

Well, we are talking about binary data, as in zeros and ones. So 220 is more logical.

1KB  1024 bytes

1MB  1024 KB  1024  1024 bytes

1GB  1024 MB  1024  1024 KB  1024  1024  1024 bytes

In binary

1KB  100 0000 0000 bytes

1MB  1 0000 0000 0000 0000 bytes

1 GB  100 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 bytes

Chadk excuse me  do you has aflavor?

The current methodology may not be strictly correct but it is understood.

Oh, really? Do people really understand that when talking about bandwidth or processor speed the prefixes have decimal meanings?

jbwebb wrote

Can you imagine the resulting mess from changing binary data metrics at this late stage?

I'm old enough that I don't need to imagine it. I lived in a world where kilo still had an unambiguous meaning. It was orderly, peaceful world of shiny happy people. Late stage, huh?In physics, kilo has meant 1000 for hundreds of years.See the section 'Historical  context' at the NIST site



NIST wrote

Once upon a time, computer professionals noticed that 210 was very nearly equal to 1000 and started using the SI prefix kilo to mean 1024. That worked well enough for a decade or two because everybody who talked kilobytes knew that the term  implied 1024 bytes. But, almost overnight a much more numerous everybody bought computers, and the trade computer professionals needed to talk to physicists and engineers and even to ordinary people, most of whom know that a kilometer is 1000 meters and a kilogram is 1000 grams.

Side note Somebody please correct the link to Brian's blog to read Brianbec's weblog instead of Brainbec's weblog.

Anyone technical enough to know about bytes, bits and hertz would be aware of the peculiarity about measuring quantities of bytes.

I'm not saying it's correct, it's just the way it is. Standards are often illogical. For example, how many standard definitions of a 'mile' are there? Imperial, US Survey, Nautical, Roman, etc. Which one of those is correct?

This could make a good poll for the other Niners

How many of you are using or plan to use correct SI units?

One minor correction Brian is not in Microsoft Research anymore. Brian and his team including Erik Meijer work in the Data Programmability team in SQL Server as do I, for that matter and do a lot of deeply collaborative development with the VB product  team.

Brian knows as well as anyone how high a bar it would be to be the best programming language. I'm happy he's trying that hard, and I think it will be pretty interesting to see how far it can go. As for CVB not being different, let me say they absolutely  can be. Sharing a runtime does not mean they are limited to the same semantics and feature sets across the board as programming languges. Consider the recent IronPython or PHP.NET releasesthey use the same runtime as C but have very different features  and in different dimensions you might consider one or the other more advanced.I can't quite remember if the Haskellimplementation in .NETBrian was playing with last year waspublically availableornot, butit falls into the same camp.
