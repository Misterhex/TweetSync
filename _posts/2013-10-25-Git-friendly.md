>This post is an excerpt from my new book, Conversational Git . The entire book is available online and its source is on GitHub . Its designed to be a quick, accessible introduction for experienced developers. Id be delighted to hear what others think.

>I recently had some close friends talk about their hesitation in adopting Git as opposed to continuing to work with Subversion. Ive used Subversion for many years, and advocated for its use. I have since jumped wholeheartedly on the Git bandwagon, so I wanted to find a way to tell the story of why I made the switch and why I think so much of the open source community is now based around Git and Gitfriendly sites like GitHub.

>These friends are smart people, and if theyre not convinced about Git, the problem is not them its that they havent seen the right argument yet. Theres so much content out there about Git, and much of it is written at a level thats way higher than my expertise. But in a way, thats an issue. When youre first starting out learning something, the questions that you have are way different from the questions an experienced person has. Once youve won that knowledge, its almost impossible to go back and think about what it was like when you were first learning. That puts you in a bad position to explain to someone else whos brand new.

>Git seems particularly prone to this because its based on some pretty complex notions of how to think about version control. In particular, once you internalize the concept of the Directed Acyclic Graph DAG that underlies basically everything in Git, you tend to want to explain that to new people because a it can help you think about how Git works and b its cool. Unfortunately, teaching Git from a DAG perspective is IMHO the worst way to teach it to new users because it suggests to them that they have to thoroughly understand complex concepts from graph theory to use Git effectively. Theres also no question that the Git help pages use Gitspecific jargon, which really interferes with nonexperts understanding what a command does.

>The book adopts a style that should be accessible to new users. Its informal , with plenty of first and secondperson references. This is not a dummies book Im not going to talk down to you, and Im not going to suggest that you shouldnt learn complex concepts about Git. But Im going to try to talk about how I use Git and how I see it being used effectively.

>I hope the book is interesting and useful and I look forward to feedback.
