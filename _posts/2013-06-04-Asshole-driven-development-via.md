>Asshole driven development
>
>The software industry might be the worlds greatest breeding ground for new systems of management . From Agile , to Extreme Programming , to Test Driven Development TDD , the acronyms and frameworks keep piling up. Why?
>
>Some say its immaturity that software is still a young industry and all the change is the path to some true fundamentals. Others say its because software people like making things up and cant help themselves. Well I say this if were going to have dozens of models we may as well have some that are honest, however cynical, to whats really going on much of the time.

>There is a happy list of these Im sure, but this is the cynical one.

>Asshole Driven development ADD  Any team where the biggest jerk makes all the big decisions is asshole driven development. All wisdom, logic or process goes out the window when Mr. Asshole is in the room, doing whatever idiotic, selfish thing he thinks is best. There may rules and processes, but Mr. A breaks them and people follow anyway.

>Cognitive Dissonance development CDD  In any organization where there are two or more divergent beliefs on how software should be made. The tension between those beliefs, as its fought out in various meetings and individual decisions by players on both sides, defines the project more than any individual belief itself.

>Cover Your Ass Engineering CYAE  The driving force behind most individual efforts is to make sure than when the shit hits the fan, they are not to blame.
>
>Development By Denial DBD  Everybody pretends there is a method for whats being done, and that things are going ok, when in reality, things are a mess and the process is on the floor. The worse things get, the more people depend on their denial of whats really happening, or their isolation in their own small part of the project, to survive.

>Get Me Promoted Methodology GMPM  People write code and design things to increase their visibility, satisfy their bosss whims, and accelerate their path to a raise or the corner office no matter how far outside of stated goals their efforts go. This includes allowing disasters to happen so people can be heroes, writing hacks that look great in the short term but crumble after the individual has moved on, and focusing more on the surface of work than its value.
