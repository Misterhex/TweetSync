Musthave Tools for Developers on Windows Part 1

02.20.2012

Cassandra in the Netflix Architecture

Every technologist has his favourite list of developer tools,  applications and OS which they believe are indispensible and without  them they would not be able to develop anything. With time and changing  focus, this list keeps changing. Here s my list of tools that I think you as a developer should have on your laptop.

Most of them are OpenSource or Freeware as I promote using  OpenSource and donating rather than buying products at premium price.  So it is possible that many excellent products have not made it to my  list!



Windows Tools

Fences  helps you organize your desktop and can hide your icons when they are  not in use. You can resize your fences read areas to keep your  desktop clean and organized

Dell Dock  bring greater organization, personalization and productivity to Dell  customers around the globe. You can use it not just on Dell  laptopsdesktops, but on any make.

7Zip  An OpenSource file archiver with high compression ratio. There is a  commercial license for organizations but you dont need to pay anything  for that too.

Paint.NET  free image and photo editing software for computers that run Windows.  This program is a very good alternative to Photoshop for developers if  not for professionals.

GIMP  Photo retouching, image composition and image authoring in multiple formats is made very easy using GIMP.

SysInternals  a service that enables you to execute Sysinternals tools directly  from the Web without hunting for and manually downloading them. The one I  used more is Process Explorer to get insight on internals of an executable.

Windows Live Writer  This is byfar the best and free tool for Blogging on various platforms with a great plugin support from community.

WinDirStat  Disk usage statistics viewer and clean up tool for Windows to analyse and freeup space.

CCleaner  Registry cleaner and makes your computer faster. There is one free version and paid versions start from 19

VirtualBox  If you have read my post on running Android OS on Windows ,  you would be aware of what VirtualBox allows you to do. It is one of  the best VHD host and manager allowing you to create image of almost any  OS and run it on Windows



Online Meetings, Webinars and Collaboration

AnyMeeting  Hold large or small meetings and web conferences. This is one of my  favourites allowing me schedule and manage my webinars. You can pay  17pm if you want an Adfree version, else its free.

TeamViewer  A very handy tool for Remote Access and Support over Internet. You  can hold conferences for up to 25 participants, or conduct training  sessions

Skype  One of the most used video conferencing tools across globe does not need any introduction.

Skydrive  25GB of online space! Only Microsoft could give you that for free.  You can sign up on Windows Live and get access to an integrated  ecosystem of Skydrive, Live Messenger, Hotmail, Calendar, Contacts,  XBOX games, Windows Phone and now Windows 8 OS.

DropBox  free service that lets you bring your photos, docs, and videos  anywhere and share them easily on platforms such as Desktop, Windows  Phone, Android and iPhone. For the first year DropBox is free, and  subsequent years there is a minimal fee.

ZoomIt  screen zoom and annotation tool for technical presentations runs  unobtrusively in the tray and activates with customizable hotkeys to  zoom in on an area of the screen. I have used it in many presentations  on Windows Phone, Silverlight, Performance Engineering and have found it  really handy!



Microsoft .NET developer tools

Microsoft Visual Studio 2010 Express Editions  Unless you have MSDN license or a authorised copy of Visual Studio  2010, these express editions are really MUSTTOHAVE products.

Notepad  A great texteditor with Explorer contextmenu and a IDElike  experience. If you are using TextPad or Notepad, I would highly  recommend downloading this

FileZilla  A fast and reliable crossplatform FTP, FTPS and SFTP client with lots of useful features and graphical user interface

WebMatrix  A free web development tool from Microsoft that includes platforms  such as WordPress, Razor ASP.NET MVC3 and other opensource blogging,  wiki tools.

LINQPad  interactively query databases in a modern query language LINQ using this tool instead of using SQL Management Studio

JustDecompile  new, free developer productivity tool for easy .NET assembly browsing  and decompiling and a complete replacement of .NET Reflector since its  no more free. You can also try ILSpy

SublimeText  If you are a Webdeveloper you must try the evaluation version of  this tool. It is really very intuitive, prose and has a slick user  interface with extraordinary features.

Fiddler  Easy, clean and powerful webtraffic debugging proxy for HTTP

SoapUI  This tool defines a perfect way to do functional testing using  graphical interface to create automated functional, load or regression  tests. If you want to record user tests and generate some test code  then you should try WatiN

FireBug  Most powerful inbrowser IDE on Mozilla Firefox allowing you to  browse through HTML, CSS and Javascript. If you want to check your web  pages performance, you might want to try out YSlow by Yahoo

NCrunch  Automated continuous testing within Visual Studio.NET that runs in  background in your IDE and get information such as Code Coverage and  Performance metrics.

KDiff3  is an alternative to BeyondCompare to compare files, directories and automate merging of code.

HelpNDoc  Is a really great tool to generate documentation in PDF, Webbased, CHM, Word and iPhone for personal use

LogParser  Log parser is a powerful, versatile tool that provides universal  query access to textbased data such as log files, XML files and CSV  files, as well as key data sources on the Windows operating system such  as the Event Log, the Registry, the file system, and Active Directory



Source Control and Versioning

I prefer using Subversion and Mercurial for source control and versioning. So heres the list

Windows Shell  TortoiseSVN for Subversion and TortoiseHG for Mercurial

Visual Studio Plugin  AnkhSVN for Subversion and VisualHG for Mercurial



Thats just half of the list, so stay tuned for the next part where  tools for Silverlight, Windows Phone, XAML, Websharing would be the  focus!
