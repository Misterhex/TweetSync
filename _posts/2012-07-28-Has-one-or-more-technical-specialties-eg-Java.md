>When you                    get your                    first                    job as                    an IT                    professional                    it is                    often in                    the role                    of a                    junior                    programmer                    or                    junior                    DBA. You                         will initially focus on becoming good at that role, and                         if youre lucky your organization will send you on training courses to pick up advanced skills in your                         specialty. Once                         youre adept at that specialty, or even when youve                         just reached the point of being comfortable at it, it is                         time to expand your horizons and learn new skills in                         different aspects of the software lifecycle and in your        relevant business domain. When you do this you evolve from being a specialist                    to being                    a                    generalizing                    specialist.

>Figure                      1 depicts a fictional        skills assessment of an IT professional, showing how it        evolves over time. In this example, the person has        solid skills in Java development, and some initial        skills in modeling, testing, and database administration DBA . Then, two years later,        theyve improved all of their skills, including their        Java programming skills. They may have achieved        this through training  education , mentoring , or collaborative techniques such as modeling with others or pair        programming . Then, three years later their        skills have improved further, although its interesting        to note that focus on a new skillset .Net programming        may have motivated the person to let their Java        programming skills go stale. Its incredibly rare for someone to become super skilled at everything, more on this later , although it is quite common for a generalizing specialist to become more skilled than either a generalist or a specialist.

>Why Generalizing                    Specialists?
>
>There are several reasons why you should        prefer to build teams from generalizing specialists
>
>Improved                     communication                     and                     collaboration. A generalizing specialist is                         someone with a good grasp of how everything fits                         together. As a result they will typically have a greater                         understanding and appreciation of what their teammates                         are working on. They are                         willing to listen to and work with their                         teammates because they know that theyll likely learn                         something new. Specialists,                         on the other hand, often dont have the background to                         appreciate what other specialists are doing, often look                         down on that other work, and often arent as willing                         to cooperate. Specialists, by their very nature,                         can become a barrier to communication within your team.                   Another                    challenge with specialists is that they                         have difficulty working together effectively with others                         because they                         dont have the background to understand the issues                         that the others are trying to deal with.

>Less                     documentation. Specialists are often motivated to create                         far more documentation than is required, when all you                         can do is write use cases then those use cases will end                         up including information that could be better recorded                         elsewhere, and very likely require reviews of said                         documentation when they provide it to other specialists. The implication is that the same piece of                         information will often be captured by several                         specialists because theyre afraid that theyll lose                         that information. Its                         quite common on projects dominated by specialists to see                         a business rule captured in a user interface                         specification, in a business rule specification, in a logical                         data model LDM , in a UML                         class diagram , in acceptance tests , and in source                         code. Clearly                         theres a chance that the business rule will be                         described inconsistently thereby motivating more bureaucracy                     in                     the                     form                     of traceability  let alone the obvious overhead                         involved with reviewing and maintaining each version of                         it. A generalizing specialist will write less                         documentation than a specialist because they have a                         greater range of options available to them. Instead of having a user interface specialist                         capture the rule in a screen specification, the data                         specialist capture it in an LDM and so on the                         generalizing specialist will instead capture it in the                         most appropriate places. In this case that could be in the form of one or                         more acceptance tests as well as in the source code. In short, a generalizing specialist can choose                         the best artifact to to capture the information in one and one only place. The implication is that a team composed of generalizing specialists                         will be more effective than one composed of specialists.

>Figure 5 compares people following different skilling strategies  in this case Im showing only four potential skills S1 to S4 to make my point, but in the real world you would consider much more than just four. There are three important points that I hope to make with this diagram
>
>1. Generalizing specialists are not just generalists. Time and again Ive found that people confuse the concept of a generalizing specialist with that of a generalist, but as you can see a generalizing specialist has a much different skills profile than a generalist. Remember, a generalizing specialist has a general knowledge PLUS one or more specialties, whereas a generalist just has general knowledge.
>
>2. Generalizing specialists are typically not super skilled. Although a generalizing specialist will eventually become more skilled than either someone who is just a specialist or just a generalist, that doesnt mean that they are an expert at everything. The IT industry changes too quickly so that someone can become expert at everything regardless of what their ego may be subconsciously telling them so its clearly unrealistic to expect this of someone.
>
>3. Generalizing specialists are not just specialists. A specialist is someone who is narrowly focused in a single skill, although will likely have minimal skills in a few other domains as you see in Figure 5 .

>Is                    There                    Still Room For                    Some Specialists ?

>The                    quick                    answer                    is yes,                    depending                    on the                    context. There                    are two                    categories                    of                    situation                    where                    your                    team may                    find the                    need for                    specialists

>Conclusion
>
>In many ways a generalizing specialist is                         simply a software craftsperson . The                         reason why I dont use the term software                         craftsperson is that it is a loaded one that is                         likely to turn off a large number of traditional                         developers that prefer something along the lines of software engineer. I                         believe that generalizing specialist is more                         palatable.

>In short, my experience is that                         generalizing specialists are much more effective than                         either specialists or generalists. The best developers are generalizing                         specialists, or at least actively are trying to become                         so. There                         is still room for specialists within your IT department, they can often act as internal consultants                         to your development teams, but as IT departments become                         more agile I suspect that we will see fewer specialists surviving over                         time.

>Agile Modeling Effective Practices for Extreme        Programming and the Unified Process is the seminal        book describing how agile software developers approach modeling and documentation . It describes principles and        practices which you can tailor into your existing        software process, such as XP , the Rational Unified Process RUP , or the Agile Unified Process AUP , to streamline your        modeling and documentation efforts. Modeling and        documentation are important aspects of any software        project, including agile projects, and this book        describes in detail how to elicit requirements , architect , and then design your system in an agile manner.

>The Object Primer 3rd Edition Agile Model Driven        Development with UML 2 is an          important reference book for agile modelers,          describing how to develop 35 types of agile          models including all 13 UML 2 diagrams . Furthermore, this book describes the techniques          of the Full Lifecycle Object Oriented Testing          FLOOT methodology to give you the fundamental          testing skills which you require to succeed at          agile software development. The book also          shows how to move from your agile models to          source code  Java examples are provided as well          as how to succeed at implementation techniques          such as refactoring and testdriven development          TDD . The Object Primer also includes a          chapter overviewing the critical database          development techniques  database refactoring , objectrelational mapping , legacy analysis , and          database access coding from my awardwinning Agile Database Techniques book.

>The Elements of UML 2.0 Style describes a collection        of standards, conventions, and guidelines for creating effective UML diagrams . They are based on sound, proven        software engineering principles that lead to diagrams        that are easier to understand and work with. These        conventions exist as a collection of simple, concise        guidelines that if applied consistently, represent an        important first step in increasing your productivity as        a modeler. This book is oriented towards        intermediate to advanced UML modelers, although there        are numerous examples throughout the book it would not        be a good way to learn the UML instead, consider The Object Primer . The book is a brief 188        pages long and is conveniently pocketsized so its easy        to carry around.
