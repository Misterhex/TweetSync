It depends on what you are planning to program.

I think a good exposure to Algebra, Asymptotic analysis, Proving techniques, Logic and Techniques on reasoning with both abstraction of process and abstraction of information should be adequate to do most of the demanding programming tasks.

However, my personal experience has shown that Basic Discrete MathsSet theory, Logic, Combinatorics, Graph theory, Probability and Statistics is invaluable. The more ideas you understand from these fields, the better your problem solving skills will get .

In addition, ideas from mathematical disciplines like Linear Algebra, Calculus, Abstract Algebra have found their way into fields like machine learning, programming language theory, computer vision and other optimization. So it really depends on what you are focusing on. Numerical Analysis techniques could be all that you need to program in your domain or you could end up traversing a lot of esoteric fields and theorems to come up with your solution.
