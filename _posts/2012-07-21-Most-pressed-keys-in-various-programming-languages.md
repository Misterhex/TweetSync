>I switch between programming languages quite a bit I often wondered  what happens when having to deal with the different syntaxes, does the  syntax allow you to be more expressive or faster at coding in one  language or another. I dont really know about that but what I do know  what keys are pressed when writing with different programming  languages.

>This might be something interesting for people who are deciding to select a programming language might look into, here is a post on the answer to the aged question of Which programming language should I learn?

>As far as I can tell languages with a wider focused spread across the keyboard are usually syntaxes we usually associate with ugly languages ugly to read and code. ex. shell and perl.
>
>You might argue that the variables names being used will alter the  results, but as most languages programming have conventions for naming  but we can assume a decent spread for variable names. I dont offer  conclusions, just poorly layout the facts. Although the heat map does  miss out on things like shift and caps. ex. in perl with the dollar sign.
