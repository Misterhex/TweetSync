Job InterviewsWhat's the point of wearing formal dress for job interviews?

Why does someone's dress matters if he is in formals or in jeans ? For a software engineer job, do they need us to be work as models or what ? All they need is our skills  knowledge, why dressing style, fashion has to come into picture ?

any suggestions for description is welcome.

It's mainly a dominance ritual, but it also sets a bar for relatively basic social skills and tests your willingness to follow social protocols you may or may not think are dumb.

Many of the reasons are the same as those I covered here Bulat Bochkariov's answer to Business Attire Why are jeans considered unprofessional?

On the interviewer's side, they're telling you the candidate that they can set the rules for the encounter. By letting it be known that you can either do things their way or not bother coming in, they're establishing that they need you less than you need them. They have powerand you don't. Even if they do need you, accepting the implicit structure they've set up can prime you into undervaluing yourself and your position.

As a candidate, by dressing up you demonstrate two things

That you again, implicitly acknowledge their dominance.

That you're socially aware and can be sent to represent the company in situations where the other party puts more stock in social protocols than you do and has power over your employer.

Even if it's generally held inside the company that dressing up is pointless, it's critical to recognize that you might have to deal with customers, government officials, and other outside parties who will judge you by your dress and can just walk away. They'll judge you on professional appearance for exactly the same reason your employer did because they want you to believe they have the power, even if they don't, and they want to see that you're on board with that. Interviewing in professional dress is basically a dryrun of that same scenario.

Incidentally, that's why the Wall Street bankers running Facebook's IPO were so upset when Zuckerberg showed up to business meetings in a hoodie. They tried asserting dominance they didn't have and he made them look weak by calling their bluff. For people at the top of a power structure, who benefit from its entrenchment and need others to accept it even if contradicts their interests, few things are more unsettling than someone with an independent source of power questioning their rules and flouting them for all to see.

But it's not all so conspiratorial.

More mundanely, setting up these proxy signals to stand in for competence and skill gives people who are otherwise unqualified to judge you on those things a way to tell if they should trust you. That's why looking the part can be so important. You, the person dressing up, can make it work to your advantage.
