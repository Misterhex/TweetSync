>I quit my job today.
>
>Many people have said it is a bad idea to quit with nothing definitely lined up. And you know what? Maybe it was.
>
>Dont get me wrong  everything about the job including the company and my coworkers was great  except for the ACTUAL work that I had to do  nothing wrong with it  it just wasnt for me. Its like the Office Space quote along the lines of every day you see me is the new worst day of my life. Not quite true since its meant to be a comedic exaggeration, but most days do indeed suck. Most jobs are honestly not that far off from Office Space, though dont expect to find three people beating the shit out of a malfunctioning printer in a field.
>
>Were told our whole fucking lives to jump through all of these various hoops. And if we just do this next thing, were set! First, its high school  Put yourself out there! Take AP classes! Work hard if you get into a good college, youre all good!
>
>Then, in college  were told to get good grades, work hard, meet a ton of people, and get internships in our relevant field. If we do all of these things, we may land a good job...and then, life will be great! Theres nothing else to worry about!
>
>Dont get me wrong, you should do these things, and college is absolutely fantastic  but its not so linear to assume if you just do this, man, youll fucking be living a dream. Education is a step in the right direction, but not the complete answer to everything. Enough fucking schooling for like the first 20 out of 22 years of life. And dont show me any more fucking videos of live birth.
>
>On Facebook, you see people regularly beaming with excitement about internships theyve landed, big interviews they have, etc. And thats wonderful  because these are important accomplishments people should relish, as theyve likely worked hard for them. But nobody should be excited under the false pretenses that they will instantly be fulfilled with all aspects of life because of achieving employment that they think they will enjoy.
>
>Most of the people on Facebook are probably just as clueless as you think you are. The vast majority of us are clueless. And the great thing is that theres nothing wrong with that.
>
>Lets say that you land that ideal job  the one that pays well in the field youve been working towards  everything is figured out, right?!!?!? Everything that everyone has been telling you is totally true, and life is so easy now, I know it!
>
>Fuck no.
>
>Most likely, youll realize that having a real  grownup job is not that cool or that youre not as interested in something as you thought youd be. If you genuinely enjoy your job, I swear  consider yourself privileged. But dont be naive enough to just assume this.
>
>For most, the enchantment of having a job will soon likely wear off, and youre left wondering if life is essentially waking up early...to do shit you dont want to do...for 57 70 of your life for the next 40 years...with the only solace coming from weekends...where you just waste time and money doing shit like going to bars whenever youre free...because youre expected to at this age not necessarily because you even want to...though going sometimes can be a lot of fun.
>
>You get free time at night? Well, sort of, but not really. Youll likely have been sitting and staring at a computer for eight hours per day...not to mention commuting...so days are longer than you assume. Then you have chores and shit to do, like buying groceriesdoing laundry. And maybe you want to exercise. By the time all of that is done, you have an hour or so to do something. But youre too tired to do much, so you get on Facebook, Netflix, etc. Maybe, if you work really hard and are efficient with your time, youll have the ability to pursue one hobby semiseriously, which will likely be the most interesting thing about you.
>
>And then you go to sleep at an ideally reasonable hour in a futile attempt to wake up refreshed...to do it all over again. With the only solace being the idea of your weekend as it inches closer...to do the same boring shit you always do.
>
>As far as salary, its cool having money now, right!? Well, sort of. Except you dont see remotely close to the amount on your offer letter. Youll have 2730 to go to the government, money to health care, money to a 401k, money to any stock sharing plans, etc. Before you know it, yes, you have some extra spending money, but youre not a Saudi prince with a diamondcovered Mercedes like you thought youd be.
>
>If you take a job you dont like, youre effectively a prisoner that is working to simply exist...with your only real enjoyment coming from the occasional rewards of free time or spending money. Life is expensive. Theres no point to work hard doing something that you dont like...to enable you to continue working hard and doing something you dont like.
>
>You know when youll be free? When youre 62 and have saved enough in your retirement fund and 401k if its even worth anything by then to enjoy some solace. Except look at you  youre now old...you and your spouse have more wrinkles and saggy appendages than the population of Hong Kong. And you dont have the energy or vigor you used to have. Maybe you have medical problems by now and you have to pound pills like a young kid inhales a kingsized bag of Skittles on Halloween just to feel somewhat normal. Hell, you may not even make it to 62, in which case, congrats, youve thrown away your life. But hey, now youre dead  isnt it cool that you didnt get a chance to complete what you actually wanted to!?
>
>Many people will tell you this is how life is and to accept it. You put in your 40 hours per week, you are relatively comfortable, and youll retire after you put your time in. Putting time in until youre eventually free and can enjoy yourself...minus the risk of potentially being someones personal sockpuppet, sounds a lot like prison. Maybe youll learn to live with it though and it wont bother you so much...right?
>
>To me, the people that fully accept that defeatist mindset and expectancy of misery have already lost, and will have to live with their selffulfilling prophecy of mediocrity and predictability until they make a change...which, as time goes on, becomes increasingly more challenging.
>
>We work jobs we dont enjoy to buy shit we dont need to impress people we dont like. quote from Fight Club
>
>Weve been told our whole life what we SHOULD be doing. People make blanket statements about our worth through our careers, possessions,and education. And this is where it has gotten us. Living a boring and predictable existence by the agenda of others. What we think is normal and what we should be doing is about as exciting as leftover chocolate pudding. The shitty offbrand, not a Snack Pack. The path which weve forged for ourselves at the direction of those that care about us because its how they themselves were instructed to live. These are old and outdated standards. Often times, the people telling us this lived in an era where if you put in your hard work at your job, you were promoted. Jobs were more steady at that time. But now, the economy is global and things are always changing. No matter your position or skillset, you are not safe, nor are you entitled to employment. So you better get fucking comfortable with how you make a living, because youre going to have to be refreshing your skills, your network, and always evolving to keep up.
>
>And you know the thing about being normal? It fucking sucks. Its what you do when you dont know what to do. Or what you do when youre too scared to actually try what you know you should. Youre average...runofthemill
>
>...dime a dozen. When you look back on your life, do you want to be remembered as someone who spent most of their time in life at least until your early 60s as an easilyreplaceable and forgettable pawn?
>
>You get my points. So how do we fix this downward trend were on?
>
>First, stop doing shit we dont like. A prime example going to bars every moment of free time in an attempt to forget about our shitty weeks...only to realize weve squandered the small amount of free time we actually have...the thought of which alone got us through the week. And that little expendable income weve suffered for throughout the week has quickly been squandered on a temporary fix. We all know the girls sorry, not trying to be a dick, but mostly, it seems to be girls that go places to take pictures for the sole purpose of posting on Facebook to maintain the facade that they are enjoying themselves. In actuality, these are the same girls that are the biggest buzzkills and bitch about everything while theyre somewhere. This is just one example of people doing things solely because they think that its what they should be doingis expected of them.
>
>One of the things I regret is always trying to be safe and comfortable. Wow, what an atrocious mistake that mindset has been. I know countless people who could do such awesome things, but are wasting time...living a life composed of an unfulfilling and predictable routine because theres less risk of humiliation that way. So many people waste their lives being underemployed or having a lack of responsibilities for too long, without even attempting any life progress whatsoever. I dont know if its out of apathy or fear of making a choice that isnt completely certain. But the truth is that the longer people delay these choices, the more costly the indecision becomes. The longer you wait to act, the more you fall behind.
>
>So stop squandering your time and actually make shit happen.
>
>Accept failure as an exciting part of life rather than something we should avoid. Sadly, this means forgetting about what weve been told our whole lives about failing. We should try to learn shit on our own, take risks, and accept complete and utter fuckups. In doing so, well figure out what we actually like and gather meaning from it rather than exist how weve been expected to for as far back as we can remember.
>
>So stop wasting time reading this and actually do something youve wanted to fucking do. Enjoy writing? Fucking write something. Want to work for a specific company or in a certain industry? Join MeetUp or search people to message on LinkedIn and talk with people that are doing what you want to. Want to learn a skill? Well, theres a MILLION free resources and some great paid ones  check out Page on Noexcuselist , for example.

>The things you own end up owning you. Fight Club  I swear, Im not obsessed with the movie, but some quotes are fantastic  dont take a job because it pays well...because no amount of material possessions will even out any other things in your life that youre not pleased with. Youll end up complicating your own existence by thinking you need these things in an endless clusterfuck of a cycle. Its always fun to buy cool shit Im so enamored by my iPhone...but the simpler your existence is, the more liberated youll actually feel. Youll have a brief amount of time to enjoy something youve bought...and then it will quickly remind you of the bullshit you had to do that you loathed just to be able to purchase it. And now, youve converted it from something you used to gain utility or pleasure from into another artifact to serve as a bitter reminder of realizing everything you originally thought about adulthood was wrong.
>
>I think that our collective goal should be to wake up and be like Fuck yeah, another day! instead of Fuck...yeah...another day.
>
>And I think the way to get there is to smother yourself in uncertainty and making choices based on what you tell yourself  not what youre told.
>
>When you find what it is that youre supposed to do, youll probably get good at it, and then, who knows  maybe youll get rich from it.
>
>So maybe Ill fuck up with some of the other things Im trying to move intowork on independently. But living life wondering what if for the next 3040 years to plan to retire when I may be too old or six feet under by then, who knows to enjoy anything...yeah, thats not an appealing existence.
>
>And yes, for those wondering, I have money saved up, and will use the hiatus to trylearn new things while networking and searching for other employmentopportunities. Parents arent paying for anything so dont be an asshole and assume that.
>
>I gave my two weeks notice you should almost never really straight up quit...unless you want to risk potentially having a scathing reference for any future endeavors, thereby almost nullifying the work youve put in.
