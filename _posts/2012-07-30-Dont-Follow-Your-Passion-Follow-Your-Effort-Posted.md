Dont Follow Your Passion, Follow YourEffort

Posted on

March 18, 2012

I hear it all the time from people. Im passionate about it. Im not going to quit, Its my passion. Or I hear it as advice to students and others Follow your passion.

What a bunch of BS. Follow Your Passion is easily the worst advice you could ever give or get.

Why ? Because everyone is passionate about something. Usually more than 1 thing. We are born with it. There are always going to be things we love to do. That we dream about doing. That we really really want to do with our lives. Those passions arent worth a nickel.

Think about all the things you have been passionate about in your life. Think about all those passions that you considered making a career out of or building a company around. How many wereare there ? Why did you bounce from one to another ? Why were you not able to make a career or business out of any of those passions ?Or if you have been able to have some success, what was the key to the success.? Was it the passion or the effort you put in to your job or company ?

If you really want to know where you destiny lies, look at where you apply your time.

Time is the most valuable asset you dont own. You may or may not realize it yet, but how you use or dont use your time is going to be the best indication of where your future is going to take you .

Let me make this as clear as possible

1. When you work hard at something you become good at it.

2. When you become good at doing something, you will enjoy it more.

3. When you enjoy doing something, there is a very good chance you will become passionate or more passionate about it

4. When you are good at something, passionate and work even harder to excel and be the best at it, good things happen.

Dont follow your passions, follow your effort. It will lead you to your passions and to success, however you define it.

Great insight, i agree with you on this marvelous topics

Mark Cuban you are godthank you for imparting your infinite wisdom.  I see now why I am such a failure because I am not a billionaire.  There are so many people who do so much more good and have such a better grasp of reality.  To take this guys advice or buy his book is a complete waste of energy and time.  His effort is clearly fueled by his greed and ego moreso than any passion.  He has a desparate need for acceptance that he hopes his money and attempts at fame will fulfull.

Mark, lots of comments here.  First, thank you for making the point, it is generally correct.  The criticisms above for example that doing something more doesnt necessarily make you better at it please refer to books such as The Talent Code and Talent is Overrated for examples of the nuanced differences, which by the way should be taught in school are largely fair but miss the point.

There is something missing from your comments though, which is the opposite of passion.. In my experience if you hate doing something youll almost never get good at it.  The reality is yes as you do something more you get better at it, but it takes that initial motivation to get going.  Probably one of the biggest things thats worked for me in business has been delegating things I dislike doing.

So yes, pay attention to where you spend your time, learn how to get good at what youre doing and get much better at it.  Dont worry about some airy fairy esoteric answer of what youre passionate about or thinking its just one thing, but if you really dislike something find something else, life is too short to spend the majority of your time doing things you hate.

Pingback Sick of Passions, Calling, Purpose, Dreams?  Free Agent Academy

Because its important! Thank you for addressing a hugely over discussed under appreciated and unanswered dilemma in todays human crisis of how to make money. Do we need money as human beings, yes we do! So how do we do it, not at McDonalds flipping burgers, thats how. Yes, unanswered once again. But you addressed it and you know, because youre experienced. You started at the bottom like all the other squids and crabs in the sea. Most humans are crabs, pulling each other down. The few who get out of the bucket and escape the frying pan, write a book, and throw it back to the other crabs. It says, exit plan, heres how I did it But heres the wrench in the works Mark there were a Thousand other Donalds trying the Trump the real estate world, a Thousand geeks named Bill trying to create their own Microsoft, a Thousand Oprahs, and so on. How did that one, make it? Ill be honest and you know its true they all did the exact same thing and only one was chosen. All exact replicas, no difference. So is the game pure luck? Well heres an answer, finally, does your passion or your effort give you that edge to succeed, yes, the answer is yes. Is it who you know, or what you know, the answer is yes. Should you work for somebody else, or go into business, the answer is yes. Because in the end there will always be losers and winners. The real question and real answer is will you get anywhere if you go nowhere and do nothing? When a person gets up and does something, something happens. They lose or they win. But guaranteed theyd never lose, and theyll never win, if they dont get up and do something. Passion drives the masses forward. Effort is them moving forward. This will create winners and losers. Most will lose, so heres what somebody needs to tell the masses, heres the book that needs to be written not how I did it but alternatives to losing because as Mark pointed out not everybodys passion equals a winning strategy. Famous Action Storming Jackson wanted to use spears instead of guns when attacking the enemy forces of the North. That was awesome great passion! But General Lee didnt think it was a winning solution. I think you agree. Sure we have financial advisers saying invest in this and that. Save, buy a house, get an education. Thats what theyre saying, maybe theyre right, but it wont make you rich. It wont save you when Jackson comes to your town with an army on horseback carrying spears. You need options, that are not scams, that really work. How I did it, wont work for everybody, often it only works one time for one person. Will there be a second and third Microsoft or Oprah or Trump? I doubt it, maybe if he has better hair this time round. I cant answer which is better, who you know, what you know, effort, passion, but I appreciate that somebody tried tackling it and giving us a straight forward one or the other kind of answer. It takes a person of real courage and determination to help, to do something like that, because sometimes theres no right answer and a leader needs to just pick one, and it takes a real leader to do that when that leader knows the truth is that theres no right answer. Thats called doing your best regardless. Thats the definition of effort, without passion. You know youll probably lose, you know the masses cant get rich, but gosh darn it theyve got to try. Thats what Mark Cuban is saying here its impossible for you to get rich, but youve got to try!!! And Mark is praying that you do, and that you win. Because he cares about you, or why else would he have a blog? People dont love rich people, most people on here tear him up, and yet he still does this for everyone. A great man. I pray everybody listens to him, and does something. And maybe something will happen. Maybe even a win! Dont just follow your passion, find what you think might work, and do it. A rich friend said it best my job didnt make me happy, it wasnt my passion, but the profits, that made me happy, and what I did with those profits, that was my passion. Ben 0

i liked ur post, it made me think, and then read some of the other comments.  i agree with what kidmercury said  what youre passionate about, and where you spend your time and  may be one in the same itd be hard to spend a lot of time on something you werent passionate about, and you are most likely good at something youre passionate about.  but its a good point that you gotta put the TIME and WORK in to anything to be successful.

I finally see the bigger picture and message youre trying to get across Mark! If you put tons of effort to be the best banker in the world yet you still come out hating every minute of it, then go back to the drawing board. Reevaluate your DNA, find something new to put effort into and keep repeating until you find something to be PASSIONATE about. Passion is the byproduct. Marks intitial pursuits didnt pan out so he tried something NEW computers. Extremely valuable lesson for those of us who get stuck or trapped. Passions are discovered through trial and error. Just liking, loving or enjoying something isnt worthy of the passion label.

Dear Mr. Cuban and the people,

I notice many people agreeing with Mr. Cuban, even without questioning his argument or taking their own stand. Its hard for me to blame them because I know that society has shaped them this way. Just because someone is a billionaire doesnt mean they are an authority on how to do things, let alone on achievement. I have enormous respect for Mr. Cuban, but I have to say, writing things like this can be calamitous to people.

I agree with you, 1000 about time. But about your views on passion and effort, you have to be more careful, Mr Cuban. I know there are many chances that you dont read these comments but I prefer this style of commenting.

I will be the first to admit that I am not an expert on these concepts but I have adequate knowledge about this because I have experienced it and I have seen it in other people.

The fact is, yes effort or call it hard work is very important but passion must come first. You must first really love to do something, become passionate about it and then work hard at it. This is a sequence and passion of love is the first step. This, my friends is a recipe for success whichever way you define it. This applies to all aspects of life even romantic relationships.

What is even more disturbing is that Mr. Cuban was asked in an interview with Business Owner Magazine what advise would you give to small business owners, His first answer, and I quote Love what you do, he went on,.. its really finding something that you really love to do. and through the interview he stressed the importance of , knowing what you enjoy doing These are his own words. He never mentioned about anything like, effort or handwork, even  though he knows that they are important, why?. The answer is lies in this old saying. First things first He knows that loving something should come first, before you invest your effort in it. Its only natural and it was natural for him too to say this in this interview. The first segment of that interview is here

httpwww.youtube.comwatch?featureendscreenNR1vy7sgICX5m0o

Mr Cuban is like someone who say that if you go into a romantic relationship with a woman man that you dont rally love, you can work hard and find yourself loving this person and making a perfect match!! How crazy this would be. It never works

And by the way, I will assume that you meant physical effort. do you even realize that you need the mental or psychological effort first read, passion to be able to apply the handwork?. Come on, dude.

People deserve the truth, more so if there are children who read these things. Such information can be dangerous to people have not developed good judgement KIDS.

Wish you joy, love and happiness

Solomon.

April 18, 2012 at 334 pm

I agree partly.  My conflict is the following  If someone becomes really good at something that they started doing because it was the practical thing do, years down the road they will be trapped and not be able to change course.  Point  dont become really good at something if you dont really like it.

As the saying goes, men live lives of quiet desperation. Meaning, we spend most of our lives thinking of doing something else or being some place else.  We should all aspire to not be one of them.  Is that passion or effort?  Which came first  the chicken or the egg?

p.s. this post was cool. I like how you always debunk the romantic ideas people have in their head about success.

Thank you for the advise! I recently started a new job and your theory makes perfect sence to me! I love my new job and run my own business, but following your effort. I love the idea!!! It is something I can use at my full time job and my side venture!!! Thank you a bunch!!!!

April 17, 2012 at 1030 am

Mark thanks for the advice.  I had my 16 yr old read it this morning and at first he was afraid to but when he did he had this big smile on his face and said that it was about him.  He is passionate about planes, trains and weather which he was bouncing  around from one to another as to what he wanted to do for a job.  Then this year for his youth group he took it on himself to design the logo for them to use and it was by that effort that he found that he loves doing graphic arts and the more he does the more he wants to get technical with it.  He has mad a 3D countdown video and is constantly striving to learn and do more.  One more thing when he saw that you wrote the blog he said No wonder I love the Mavs! Thanks for being an encouragement to my son.

Mark you were great on Entourage, I must say. I wanted to tell you, I just signed my younger cousin up for a little sports contest called, The AfterschoolAwards. I urge other dads who love their kids, the game,  want them to be the best that they can be, to sign up. I sent in a few videos of him stealing home  striking this guy out. It was pretty cool. Im hoping if he wins the scholarship he can use it towards his college education. Your sons can too. God Bless

April 16, 2012 at 333 am

Mark i apologize for being off topic here but I am trying to reach you about our movement and a show pitch. I think your going to like it. Its totally original.

Here is the short version of what our reality show will be all about and Here is a link to the CBS coverage video of our worldwide movement 3 min segment featured on 6 oclock news httpwww.youtube.comwatch?v1FDh6zL7kRAfeatureguplcontextG21f5838AUAAAAAAAEAA

We are all about Random acts of recognition, celebrating whats going well in the world and encouraging people worldwide. The show would revolve around Team Good Signs adventures in spreading positivity. Optimism is in fashion and people are hungry for it. The reactions that we get are priceless and would make for reality TV Gold. One of the many concepts we have for a show is that we will contact a local organization and ask them to point out some people within that organization that are doing a good job and deserve some recognition. From the people that bring the coffee all the way up to the ownersdirectors etc.  We will then show up to that place and surprise them with the Good Signs and celebrate their efforts with awards and gifts! The reactions will be amazingly entertaining and empowering. This would be in addition to our regular and very fun and entertaining street activities where we do the same thing with complete strangers at random.

People absolutely Love Good Signs!

Thank you

Youd think someone like Mark Cuban who owns the Dallas Mavericks, would take some time and money to learn about SEO and content marketing. Your blog is a nasty mess no optimization and no strategy or offer. Its just a bunch of random posts with your take on how people should live their lives. Sure I agree that you should follow your effort and not your passion but how is this considered new information? Your a multimillionaire, spend some money and learn Internet etiquette!

Talk about effort? What about the effort of your part time employees. They make peanuts. Theyre there because they want to be part of the Mavs organization. Some of them a long time, 7 yrs. Now all of a sudden youve decided you dont want to spend the 100K to buy them championship rings because theyre not full time employees yet they were there working, doing what was asked of them. Some of them juggles several other jobs and school while working around the Mavs scehdule just to be part of the Mavs organization. Ive lost a lot of respect for Mark over this issue. Its ok and great to be able to spend the 100K on champagne after winning the title but then shun the little people that worked for nothing to help get you there. Ive canceled my tickets for next year. Still a Mavs fan just not a Cuban fan.

Good advice, Mr. Cuban.  My company has started a website that offers 247 access to music instruction through streaming video lessons.  It has definitely taken a lot of EFFORT to get to where we are today.  When I became a public school teacher, passion was what landed me the jobbut my effort was what kept me going, seeing the results day after day.

usual straight off the couch unbusiness like mind arranges these things in following manner

passion, purpose, market , market demand, money.

the correct way, which is hard for entrepreneurs wannabes to grasp is Market, Market demand, purpose, passion, money.

market doesnt care about your passions, no one cares but you. market cares about solutions to their problems. if you have the solution thats great for market  you will have money. leave passion for your hobby.

For my money, passion and a positive attitude can lead to trouble.  Simply put, there are too many messages of never give up  CRUST IT!.  I say Bull S!

Passion without purpose is like an empty bag.  Purpose breeds effort, very hard work, and lots of long hours to the point where people think youre obsessed.  Passion, applied to purpose, while not forgetting a plan is being on the right track.

What if your passion is for helping people, and you spend most of your time finding ways to help others.  They say the more you help people, the better your life will be, and I went to a seminar many years ago that mentioned if you focus on how to help others, wealth will follow.  If a person who was born to be of service to others, and to help whenever and wherever they can, shouldnt they continue to find ways to help, especially if it became a business, because we all know nowadays there is a business for everything.  But the main reason isnt necessarily for a profit, rather opportunity to make sure we leave a better world for our children.  I believe your children and my children are close in ages, Im on the other side of the fence than you, and I want to leave a better imprint on my children, but it seems that those that CAN help make a difference are only dabbling in the thought.  What if yoiu could make a difference, AND profit from it consider generating multimillions wouldnt you put all of your time and effort into helping others, as well as ensuring a better future for tomorrows future leaders our children?

April 3, 2012 at 902 am

Right on.  I tried to follow my passion for a couple years but I realized I was putting in way too much time and clearly wasnt making enough money.  I ditched it and focused on another idea I had.  Now I spend less time on it and I make more money.

Dear Mr. Cuban

The persistent one is at it again. Let me say first that this was an excellent post by you.  I had a great revelation after reading this post. I spent 20 hrs looking at stock charts and oning my skills. It does take time to see all the angles. Forget the poker eventhough I made a lot of money. There is way more money in swing trading  specific stocks.

I prayed to the LORD and I quit my drinking last year and I am now ready to make an impact in this glorious world. I also prayed to the LORD and I  will be working for my mentor soon. Just because I cant dunk a basketball does not mean I can not be an AET In your organization.

Remember this it is not what you can do for me it is what I can do for you. That is my goal and I will keep eating kraft dinner until I prove this to him.

As a certified career coach who routinely works with people who want to change careers but dont yet know what their ideal job is, I have a slightly different perspective. To such people, I say Follow your heart, but take your brain with you.

Too often, people fall into their careers without much thought, and this leads many people to be unfulfilled. I cant even begin to tell you how many executives Ive worked with who have followed their efforts straight into highpaying 100Kyear jobs where they are miserable.

People need to be intentional in charting a course for their career that aligns with their motivated abilities, interests, values, and personality type  knowing up front there will likely be twists and turns in the road.

The path to success  and by success, I mean a job where youre happy AND able to support yourself  is rarely straight. However, I think Alan Kay said it most eloquently, The best way to predict the future is to invent it. That makes sense, right?

I encourage people to begin with the end in mind! What kind of a career do you want to create? Come up with criteria for an ideal position that honors your core values, and then figure out what thats going to take and START WORKING. An object in motion tends to stay in motion, and an object at rest tends to stay at rest. Its a simple principle of physics.

Yes, Mark, it will invariably take EFFORT thats where Im in complete agreement with you. True clarity always comes from engagement  and sometimes that means making mistakes and learning from them  knowing what you want to avoid in the future.

Id also tell people to remember that no man is an island. Success will also likely depend on teamwork  networking contacts, supportive friends, and maybe even the help of a professional career coach and resume writer.

March 28, 2012 at 1035 am

Dont follow your effort. Follow your heart. Find a purpose. keeping looking till you find it and when you do, your heart will know it. Purpose inspires passion and passion inspires performance. Sure make the effort to develop competence too.

March 27, 2012 at 1141 am

Both viewpoints are valid follow your effort and follow your passion. The main article takes if from one end if you put a lot of effort into something and become good at it, you enjoy it more and will likely develop some passion for that Yes, I can see how that could happen as it appeals to our ego to be good at something and passion comes from there.

However, there is another way.  Find something you are passionate about already, and put all your effort into that.  Some triage has to be done here, and some gazing into the future call it planningprojection if you want!.  First, look at your passions in turn, and take them to their ultimate, best possible outcome, the rein that in to the most realistic, likely outcome.  Triage by holding that against what you materialistically want from life.  You should pick the one that has a most likely outcome that matches those aspirations, or the materialistic aspect will make you unhappy.  You need both sides to balance to be happy.

Then, by all means, put your effort into that.  As you are already passionate about it, you should find that easy and enjoyable, even if it is really, really hard work.

Word to the wise and passionate dont forget the balance.  Dont forget to leave time for friends, family, other passtimes.  At the beginning, its fine to focus so much on the work that other aspects pass you by a bit, but dont fall in to the trap of work work work.  You cant expect the rest of your life to sit there waiting for you to return to it.

I firmly believe that you need a little give and take in ALL areas of life to find that balance that makes you happy overall.

Other warning dont put your effort into a passion that, it it turns into a business, you will fall out of love with I have been training in aikido for 27 years now.  If I were to try to turn that passion into a living, I would probably be quite poor! but would also see aikido as a business and, soon, no longer as a passion but an obligation.  That would be tragic.  But, a little lateral thinking can help if I had managed to become wealthy enough, I can see myself setting up a martial arts centre, staffing it with some of the top people I have met and am fortunate to be able to call friends.  Add some aerobics, yoga, pilates, spin classes, a weights  machines area, some fitness trainers and great marketing, and you have an operation that can bring standard people in and enough variety in the martial arts that the centre itself makes enough money that the aikido on its own is not the business.  Then, you dont have that lovekilling focus.  Bonus martial arts teachers usually come with ready made classes and a lot of people clamouring for even more hours of training.  A centre at reasonable rates also often attracts other arts  just make sure you screen for quality both in terms of teaching and in terms of people.  One bad egg can kill your brand.

Pingback Non seguire la tua passione, ma il tuo impegno  Infinite Backlinks Blog

I have felt that passion or loving what you do is overrated for some time now.  Sugar Ray Robinson was the greatest boxer in history, made a fortune from it, and hated every minute of it.

I think it depends on what you want out of your life.  If you just want to be happy whatever that means, then I would say have at it.  Do what you enjoy, chase your dreams, and just be happy with whatever income you can make from it.  Good luck  with that by the way.

If making a lot of money is more important to you, which I dont see as immoral at all, there are 2 routes.   The first is to find something youre really really good at or become really good at something and milk that for profit.  This will be the bulk of the effort that Mark is writing about.  Two important notes  1 You need to be really really good.  Just being as good as everyone else will not put you in a position to make lots of money. 2 you need to find or master this thing as young as possible.  Nothing is worse than waking up at 40 years old, with a family and bills, and realizing you have no saleable skills, knowledge, or experience with which to make a comfortable living. Millions of Americans make exactly this mistake by the way.

The second route is the entrepreneurial route.  To make it short, find opportunities and exploit them oversimplifying a bit I know.  This will require knowledge, hard work, research, persistence, and money.  People who say you can start a business with little or no money are liars  usually trying to sell you something.

Unless you are already financially comfortable, avoid all forms of gambling at all costs.  This includes poker, trading of any kind, and the lottery.

Set your financial goals based on the life you want to live.  Example  Nice home, 2 cars, 2 nice vacations per year is achievable with mid to high six figures or a few million.  Becoming a billionaire like Mark would be a nice icing on the cake, but it isnt necessary to be financially comfortable.

And dont forget  dont ever forget, Money cant buy happiness, but happiness cant buy shit.

My first encounter with follow your passion was at an angel investment forum in California. Everyone introduced themselves by their name and passion. I found it rather embarassing. Was really tempted to say My passion is sex. Lots and lots of sex would be really awesome!

I think it may be a matter of how you interpret the word Passion. My Midwestern upbringing led me to associate the word Passion with family or ones deeply held beliefs.

It took me awhile to acclimate to the California definition, which I believe to be more along Marks definition of effort. As in What sustains you? What becomes easier the more you do it? What recharges your batteries in the act of doing?

So, maybe a California Passion is kinda like a Texas Effort.

Pingback Finding your passion  intense suggestion found in blog post comment  Geek And Dad's Blog

I am really surprised about the controversy this has garnered.  I see Marks post as common sense.  See what you like doing, the chances are you are already doing a lot of it.  If you like coding youre coding a lot of the time.  If you like sports, then you are either playing or watching a lot of sports.  Make that your focus, build a businesscareer around it.  Chances are you will be able to devote the time required  to it to make it successful. People vastly underestimate how hard it is to be successful

I see problems when someone sees something cool and believes that that is their passion without ever having done it.  If they like it so much, why arent they already doing it?

March 21, 2012 at 201 pm

I liked the ideas here so I showed this to a friend whose viewpoint I find to be wiser and less subject to tunnel vision than my own and her comments were

Out of touch with so many people IMHO. People who spend the majority of the time working hard at a job because it puts food on the table. All that hard work doesnt make them love their job any more.

Not only that but I think lots of people Dont Know what their many passions are or have not had the opportunity to follow them.

I could go on

Sounds like she thinks youre an outoftouch elitist white male without a clue what the majority of peoples lives are like.  Be interesting for you to spend some time with other sectors of American society and see if your ideas seem good in those contexts.  I look forward to a post about your experience if you do this.

From MC Trust me, I try to always put my self back in that position. Where I was working jobs just to pay the bills, having to write checks to friends who wrote checks to my landlord or the electric company just to buy a day or two to get the money in my account.

Even when I was exhausted I would dream about the things I would love to do. I still have the lists I would make of dream jobs. I had no interest in technology back then. It wasnt what I was passionate about. But I happened to get a job doing it. And while I thought my passions were elsewhere, and a lot more exciting than selling computers, i found that the more I worked with computers, the better I got, the better I got, the more I liked them. This came after having jumped between jobs, getting fired and just trying to pay the bills. Not everyone falls into the right job and ends up really liking it. But everyone who is in a job that dont like dreams of what they would rather be doing and thinks that is their passion. Many of us not only dream, we dabble. But when those dabbles turn into effort, every waking and available moment type of effort, you will be amazed how good things can happen. The problem is that most people never get past messing around with things they like. they dont commit the effort

Greetings all!

Some great comments here. As a career development specialist and one who has worked with young people in and out of schools for 35 years, I DO promote the notion that finding something you are passionate about is KEY to loving what you do. And I dont think you disagree Mark. What I heard you saying is that if you work hard at something, you get good at it. if you get good at it, you likely develop a passion for it. So you ARE saying that one should do something you are passionate about right?

I dont see you promoting doing something youre good at but hating it, are you? I dont think so. So it seems to me that we are advocating the same thing, but going about it differently. Stats in your country, and mine Canada, show that over 50 of the working population HATE their jobs! Im going to speculate that some of those people are actually really good at what they do and work hard doing it. But they have no passion for it. Are these the kinds of numbers we want to perpetuate?

When we work with young people and encourage them to pursue work based on labor market information and what they may be cut out to do based on some inaccurate computer career interest inventory, we are doing them a disservice! Following ones passion, even if one has many and by the way, in my work with young people, I dont see many of them having LOTS of passionsmaybe one or two, if any, will enable one to work through obstacles, make sacrifices, do anything they need to do to make their passion a reality. As an NBA owner you see those types of people everyday dont you??? I dont think you become an NBA player without PASSION do you?

And by the way, some folks commented on the fact that they dont really understand what following your passion actually means. To me, those people havent yet found theirs or they would know. And heres a way to find outthis comes from relationship guru David DeidaSit or lie in a room very quietly and think about what it is you want to do with your life. You can only get up for from where you are for 3 reasons

1 bathroom breaks

2 food

I read this blog because of a discussion that took place last night. This is an excellent topic. Passion is at the very core of my work and I believe it is the fire that fuels success. I agree that effort is essential and a love for pet rocks will probably not pay the bills. However, a passionate effort will always prevail. Passion multiples your effort. Every player in the NFL has given and does give an effort. Its the players that love and have a passion for the game that go to the Hall of Frame.

The question then becomes, can you work hard, give an effort, and not be passionate about the work? Chicken before the egg.

Wouldnt you argue however, that youd be best served by choosing in step 1, to work hard at something youre passionate about?

Not to say that your passion begets success, but that youd be better off working hard and putting forth an extraordinary effort into something youre passionate about in the first place.

Have been perplexed by the success of Mark Cuban and yet the more I listen and read and withhold judgement about the perception that he is an immature guy who berates refs, the more I appreciate the effort, hard work and dedication he puts into the pursuit of excellence. This blog is simple and profound, that is a nice gift to receive.

how you spend your day IS the best indicator of how your future will turn out. thats good advice. but not everyone can change how they spend their day.

passions can come or go. true.

but stop making the argument so judgmental and simplified. how many US citizens are stuck in 8 an hour retail work that constantly beats you down and demands all your energy? you get stuck in debt, you have to learn how to fix your own stuff because you cant afford a repair man much less replacement, and if youre trying to support anyone besides yourself, you have no way to follow the passions you were indeed born with, and so they become vague memories. this is a pretty common story if you get out there.

and you mock them and tell it like its their decision. its easy to beat down the little guy and tell him to shut up than to look at it from a balanced perspective, eh Mark?

March 20, 2012 at 436 pm

its a well thought out and well versed argument almost like a trial lawyer..that makes you believe in  what isnt actually completely trueits the eternal question of whether the chicken came first or the egg ..the effort that the blogger is talking about is directly proportional to the passion in the specific field..now mind you effort is of many kinds.it may be cent percent effort or a half hearted effort and every thing in between.bill gates was passionate about his field,his effort bore fruit now each one of us know at least an alcoholic or smoker who made many efforts to leave hisher habit..but they were not passionate about their choice.and we all know were they are now..

March 20, 2012 at 1236 pm

In order for success to materialize, passion and effort need to work in tandem. Without either, real success isnt possible. Effort is motivated by some level of passion in all circumstances. A person may not be passionate about their particular work and still exert great effort because they have some underlying passion motivating their action, for example, making money.

March 20, 2012 at 1207 pm

I dont think this is an eitheror scenario.  The best path is to identify what youre passionate about and then work really hard at it.

Like, for example, maybe you really love college basketball, so you found an internet radio company to listen to Indiana games in Dallas.  Or you really love a local basketball team, so you use your proceeds from your internet radio company to buy them and work really hard to build them into a champion.

 

Pingback Bonne journe!  Pierre Potvin

Following a passion is not everybodys cup of tea. So if one gets disheartened easily or measures oneself with the our colleagues material success, this game is just not right. But, there is other category of people passionate people who dont need borrowed yardsticks for themselves. For this second category, sticking to a wrong choice could turn out to be an emotional suicide.

You can choose to ignore the outside world but how, will you choose to ignore that little persistent voice in your head May be I should have given it a try. If you look around this world is a better world because of passionate people who chose to take a huge chance that could have ruined their lives. I came here from facebook, had Mark chosen to follow his efforts studies, we wouldnt be talking here. Some other examples are Bill gates and Steve jobs.

Follow Your Passion is bad advice?  I disagree.  Sounds to me like the people who piss and moan about passion being bad are people who gave up following their dream, so they are justifying their choice to abandon their passion for the pursuit of money.  Either that or they already have money and used passion to get it, but they dont recognize it.

The truth of the matter is, you can have passion AND money, but you have to take a good look at Reality.  What is the world willing to pay for?  What are your talents and strengths?  Can those strengths and talents be used to passionately pursue a goal that will result in financial freedom?  If so, youve got it all.

People who argue against passion might say that the Waste Management mogul or the Septic Tank Business Entrepreneurs didnt make their millions from passion who would love filthy waste and garbage?  Rather, these dirty job millionaires took emotion completely out of the equation and used cold hard logic alone to create their empire.

I say Bullshit!  EVERYONE who pursues and succeeds at a lofty goal, no matter how unglamorous or ugly STILL HAS PASSION toward it.  They may not love the garbage but they certainly get a great deal of satisfaction from knowing that they are helping others to clean up their lives.  They get satisfaction from ridding the world of unsightly filth and leaving the Earth a cleaner and more organized place.  They know deep down that what they are doing is noble and a great service to others, even if it smells bad.  Maybe these entrepreneurs wouldnt say those exact words, but they sure as hell feel that way, even on a subconscious level.

I think too often people have a very narrow view of passion.  They think it means anything that provides instant gratification and trivial pleasure.  They say Im passionate about watching TV or playing golf, but I know I cant make money with that so therefore passion doesnt work.  Bullshit!  First of all, try growing a bit and pursuing loftier things in life.  Develop higher skills and interests.  If your passions are mere distractions, then yeah no shit, you cant make a living from them!  How about people who are passionate about Sales?  Or owning Real Estate?  Or Illustrating and Design?  Or playing Music?  Or building an organization?  Or Inventing?  Granted, perhaps not all those things will pay off for the person who is passionate about them. however, there are HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS of examples of people who ARE doing just fine pursuing those dreams  with passion.

March 19, 2012 at 841 pm

Good way of looking at it. But what happens to those people whos friends and family give them false praises about a piece of shit idea or concept clouds their vision?

Mark, you say it all the time on Shark Tank people who get led into sinking their life savings into a crap idea, because of all the false praises they get throughout their years of effort. Making it their life i.epassion makes them stick to that idea, leading them to a downward spiral.

Reason people become passionate about something is because they are good at it. Effort I believe just provides a void that is most times filled with false praise or false hope.

You were in the Internet industry. Im thinking you bought over the Mavs because of your passion for basketball. And now we have a NBA Championship ring. Yeah! Yeah!

And I think that is why people are driven by passion, because of badasses like you. Enough of the butt kissing. Sucks I didnt run into you this SXSW. But if you missed that fat Chipmunk throwing acorns during the day and pretty good looking Indian kid by night from last SXSW, Id love to come over for some coffee or AVION Tequila.

Dont Follow Mark Cuban, Follow Your Passion

Sometimes Mark Cuban is right on the money and other times hes bouncing around the court like a mad man. This is one of those times when Im left scratching my head. Marks post about abandoning passion for the bitter embrace of a cubicle is one of the most irresponsible pieces of advice Ive seen offered by an influential business figure.

Contrary to his assertion, follow your passion is indisputably the best advice anyone can receive. I can only guess that what Mark was trying to drive at is that making a living from your passion isnt too realistic in todays world  a point welltaken. But that sad reality doesnt make the advice to follow your passion any less right.

The fact is people work ten times harder, faster, better when doing what theyre passionate about. The key question is whether that love and drive can be turned into money, because without money we cant survive.

For some, success through passion happens almost overnight for most others, it takes years, even decades, before they either succeed or have to give up and join the regular workforce. Unfortunately too many people work to live instead of the other way around and thats a real shame. Whoever is lucky enough to break out of that mold should absolutely do so and do it as early in life as possible.

The fundamental question for each dreamchaser to decide for themselves is for how long to chase a passion before it becomes too unrealistic to make a living from it.

Of course theres no success without effort, so Marks point about working hard is a good one but thats no revelation. Most of us learned that early on when, through overreliance on Cliffs Notes, we were handed that heartstopping Dminus on the English Lit midterm. We learned that day that there are no shortcuts.

Most egregious of all Marks points was in saying passion follows effort. His point of view is dangerously naive and just plain wrong. I have a feeling Mark Cubans own path proves that. I think its pretty obvious that he is immensely passionate about technology and he managed to turn that healthy obsession into billions. So why teach others to pursue any different a path than he himself followed? Just because somethings difficult doesnt make it wrong.

The truth is, effort follows passion, not the other way around, and theyre really a package deal. Love something and the effort will cascade out of you uncontrollably. Thoughtleaders like Mark Cuban should empower people to succeed by doing what they love, not encourage them to get a real job and hope one day passion sprouts up out of nowhere.

It shouldnt be Marks job to point out to us the harsh realities of life thats for us to find out on our own during our rollercoaster journey. What we need to hear from successful people like him is that the seemingly impossible can be achieved and the best way to achieve big things is by doing what you love.

If we have to settle for less then so be it but not a moment before the dream is given its fair shot.

March 19, 2012 at 212 pm

Your attack should be against the application of passion and hard work. People put effort and hard work into the things they love to do, they do not devote their time to the things they hate or even dislike.

The reason people fail when pursuing their passionshard work is because they have not figured out the economic value of their efforts.  Jim Collins said it best in his most recent book, Great by Choice Fire bullets, then cannonballs. You have to test the economics of your passionhard work through empirical evidence before you devote all of your time into an endeavor.

Pingback What would you say ya do here?  The Spring of Sara

I normally agree with most things you have posted in the past but this one is a little iffy, sorry Mark.  For one, a waitress can work a job for 10yrs and get good at it, but that doesnt mean shell develop a passion for serving food just because of that.

The best advice I could give to anyone is to find a direction and stick with it.  Keep moving forward.  Find ways to motivate yourself to keep moving in a singular direction towards a singular goal.  Its ok to have several goals, longterm and shortterm but try to stick with one at a time.  Make sure the passion that drives you wasnt concocted from magazine pictures or movies.  It has to come from a real life experience.

The problem with most folks is they have too many passions and bounce from one thing to another.  Many people spend too much time on the wrong things and never get anywhere in life.

I would say everyone needs to analyze reallife experiences that has made them happy, return to it, investigate it, feel it outfind ways to dedicate more time to those things that ultimately make you feel better.  Ours days are all numbered, whether youre a billionaire or a peasant.  Every day I remind myself I could die tomorrow so I try to squeeze out as much joy out of today as I can while continually moving in one direction towards one goal, just in case today wasnt my last

March 19, 2012 at 1258 pm

Love ya Mark but have to disagree partly.  A persons passion is generally what they are naturally good at.  You can have higher success in that passion field than you would doing something else.  Of course you still have to work, do things your uncomfortable with, struggle, fail and everything else either way.  But weve seen passions lead many people to do incredible things Donald Trumps passion for the details in his buildings, Steve Jobs passion about the look and design of his products, etc.  You can be highly successful whether you pursue your passion or not, but with the passion youll be doing something you enjoy on a much deeper level imo.

Pingback Monday links setbacks as opportunities  Abnormal Returns

Heres the problem with that advice Mark, most people do exactly that.  They pick something usually for the wrong reason and work real hard at it cause thats what everyone has told us from birth, work hard and then they get results and maybe even become good or great at it.  Of course they like it more but dont mistake that for passion, they are liking the wrong thingspraise, more money, being comfortable.  Then, they wake up one day and realize they dont want to do this shit anymore and never really did or more tragic they never realize that or do nothing about it.  Ah, the American trap, I mean American Dream.  What would you do for free?  Pick that and put effort behind it and the money will follow.

Mark,

Im surprised at how a person of your caliber can be so simplistic Not to be confused with pragmatic. Ivan Kroobetskiy, youre dead on with your post, love it!

To me it demonstrates that LUCK is just as important as smarts and hard work.

P.S. please dont come back with the cliche that You make your own luck, because thats BS.

March 19, 2012 at 1147 am

1. When you work hard at something you become good at it.

Not true. Lots of people work hard at math or physics and they never become good at the subject. They simply do not have the capacity. Effort must be focused prudently on abilities that have potential for return. Like stocks. Being introspective enough to identify strengths is the single most important first step to becoming successful. Very few people know what they are actually good at.

2. When you become good at doing something, you will enjoy it more.

Also not true. In fact, in a lot of instances it is the opposite. Take gifted children in regular schools for example. Extremely intelligent children in a regular educational setting sometimes will get mediocre grades because theyre doing just enough work to not get noticed. They know the material, so not point in putting anymore effort into anything. Why bother? They good at learning, but they dont care. Such cases are part of the reason why standardized testing became in vogue.

3. When you enjoy doing something, there is a very good chance you will become passionate or more passionate about it.

The good chance is a nice cover, but this is also not true for reasons cited above.

4. When you are good at something, passionate and work even harder to excel and be the best at it, good things happen.

This is the myth that hard work always pays off. Its a great bumper sticker, but its not true. To be successful, a certain formula has to develop. Effort is part of it, but not all of it. Timing is important. So is the ability to recognize opportunities when they appear and a willingness to take chances. More likely than not, an individual will fail at least once or twice at something before reaping the fruits of their labor, so accepting failure and not being stopped by it also is essential.

Mr. Cuban, there is no simple math to becoming successful. Success is not one size fits all. And once someone, such as yourself has reached the pinnacle of their chosen field, it is very easy to look back and say Hard work is what got me here. Because thats what you remember. The work. But what about the opportunities others afforded you? The chances you took? The failures that showed where not to tread? Those things are as important, if not more so, than your ardent effort.

I agree with some of what you said only because you are Mark Cuban and apparently you have a winning formula that has worked for you. If you were anyone else, I would say that passion produces effort and effort in turn produces results. Others here give passion about name by defining it as a lack of will to work,  argumentative, or flowerchild. My take is that a person without passion for what he or she does will not put forth the effort it takes to see things through. He or she will not have the persistence to see the project through regardless of setbacks. So, Mr. Cuban, I salute your passion and effort because without either, my nephew would not be so happy about the Mavericks becoming NBA Champs. He is 23 yearsold and has been following the team since he was 15 or 16.

March 19, 2012 at 1027 am

Im a business and life coach and I think all of us sometimes interchange passion for dreams or objectives.  Couldnt agree more, Its nice to be passionate about a subject, but it takes planning, focused effort, money and risk to get what you want.

Passion is a feeling execution of a well defined plan is path to success and putting your passion to work.

March 19, 2012 at 1027 am

Mark,

Your advice is why 67 of the workforce is disengagedGallup poll 2011. We will spend 85,000 hour at work in our life time. The current american model suggests that we go to school, get good grades, learn a skill, and get paid for that skill. This model is flawed, leaving people ineffective, frustrated and miserable. How many of your college buddies are doing what they learned in college? The your bullet points are flawed frontwards and backwards. You will be successful when you are mix passion, talent, skill, and self determination. The the more time you put into your skill is really the delineating line, most people dont put in the 10,000 hours to be at the top of their field, the ones that put in their 10,000 hours inside of their passion, talent and self determination are the outliers. People like you! Tell me you are not passionate at bballlol. lets see you go buy a hockey team and lets see how successful it islol

March 19, 2012 at 1004 am

Great post Mark. I really like how you explained this because I often think about what Im passionate about and wonder why I do not just quit my job and go do that. This helped explain how to choose where you might want to go with your career, etc.

Following your passion may not make us rich like you Mark, so if wealth is your yardstick, you are probably talking good sense. It takes all kinds and I will throw my two cents in about how passion is related to a good career here httpacademy.justjobs.comknowyourselffollowyourbliss

March 19, 2012 at 957 am

Cuban is right. I will say this. Its not a eitheror issue as much as its a bothand issue. Weve gotta be passionate, but weve also gotta give strong and determined effort. Also, you dont become a billionaire just being passionate. I see his passion on the sidelines when the Mavericks play ball. The part we dont see is the effort that he puts in when hes not on the sidelines.

Thanks Mr. Cuban

Bring it on Mark! Look, I have the utmost respect for you and your accomplishments. I love watching you on Shark Tank and to be honest, Im usually waiting for your response because I find myself in complete agreement. On this one, there are no nods. I will take you ontotally disagree.

Its funny, my husband, who is also now my business partner came into my office to mention the irony between your post today and a little blurb that I did on the Anderson show  httpwww.andersoncooper.com20120316moremilliondollartipsfromajandamberschaub . Were both fans, but he knew your post would light my fire!

As a fellow entrepreneur, I know that I could not devote this much time, effort, and energy to something that did not evoke passion and fulfillment deep in my soul. I recently read a great article and total agree with the statement that entrepreneurship is an irrational pursuit. Seriously, who in their right mind is willing to make these kinds of sacrifices for something that is not guaranteed? The only way this becomes in any way justified is the human need to do something bigger than yourself. I personally believe that this is a required passion of pretty much any entrepreneur, or at least any successful entrepreneur.

I think I get your point, and where you are trying to go with this. It is not often that I completely disagree with you, but if Ive learned anything from you, its never hold back!

March 19, 2012 at 451 am

Its funny that you posted this just after I watched the TED talk by Larry Smith called Why you will fail to have a great career. Funny and insightful 14 minutes. You should check it out.

No one can argue that the amount of effort you put into something determines what you get out of it.  But I think the problem is that most people dont really know what they are passionate about in the first place.  Most people arent that introspective.

And Id argue that you have actually followed your passion from day one.  You are passionate about the competition.

March 18, 2012 at 1123 pm

The only reason that there are so many people who agree with this advice is due to the fact that with this post, from a notable business man, they found out a way to scape from the hard work of trying to reach their dreams. Perhaps this advice works for Mark because he is so competitive that being the first in something is what counts to him. In other words, his dream is to be the first one. It doesnt matter if he is working in a business andor an activity that he dreamt about.

March 18, 2012 at 1114 pm

Love this post.  I see so many people bounce around chasing their passions. Your advice going where you spend your time rings true.

March 18, 2012 at 821 pm

I agree and I dont.  Absolutely, what you invest time in and what you sacrafice for will completely out duel passion alone.  No question.  BUT, your passion or better yet what you love, combined with what you invest your time in can give you an opportunity to be great.  Thanks! httpwww.allbasketballreview.com

Brilliant.  Couldnt have said it better myself.  In fact, I dont know if anyone could have said it better.  Love the line  Follow Your Passion is easily the worst advice you could ever give or get.

So true.

Where you invest your time and your money is the best indication what you should build a business out of.  I invest my time and money learning about marketing, advertising, sales, business development.  Hundred of hours and thousands of dollars each and every year.  Forget about Passions, Strengths, likes and dislikes.

The only way youre going to become good at anything is to spend thousands of hours perfecting your craft. Getting coaching.  Learning through trial and error.  10,000 hours in fact  see Malcolm Gladwells Outliers for more on this.

Im passionate about other things too.  Watching the NBA, Formula one and Shark Tank.  The only catch is not one is going to pay to watch or observe me doing these things.  So you cant make a business out of them.

Im in college. I have four majors in a variety of areas and Im trying to figure out what I want to do once I graduate. I want to figure out where Im going, but I never have an answer when people ask me what Ill be doing after school.

From mc whats the rush ? Get any job that interests you and pays the bills. you will be getting paid to learn a business and to learn about yourself as well. That job and the next job and the next will pay you to learn far more about yourself than you will learn paying for more education. There will come a time when you will hopefully have it figured out, the day you graduate is not that time

March 18, 2012 at 518 pm

I dont know, Mark.  I was passionate about righting a wrong in the world, which I happen to be able to profit from.  If I wasnt passionate about fixing the problem, then I wouldnt be doing this.  With that said, I agree, just because youre passionate about something, doesnt mean you dont have to put massive amounts of effort into it.  But, again, if youre that passionate about it, youll put the effort into it.

March 18, 2012 at 507 pm

A better, and truer, formulation than follow your passion would be follow your destiny. The Greeks had a notion of eudaimonia, which is the intrinsic satisfaction that comes from pursuing an activity that best expresses ones basic nature. A modern version of this idea was developed by philosopher David L. Norton, who put it this way There is a distinctive course of life that is right for each individual, amid countless possibilities. This is the individuals vocation, variously termed his or her genius, daimon, Buddha nature, or atman. It consists in innate potentialities that predispose persons to a particular direction in life. As distinguished from other possibilities, the actualization by an individual of his or her potentialities affords intrinsic rewards to that personthat is, the activity is personally fulfilling and satisfying. Selfknowledge, then, is knowledge of the activities, situations, and relationships that the individual experiences as intrinsically rewarding. Engaged at these, the individual invests the best of himself or herself and strives continuously to improve, while in the process contributing objective values to others.

March 18, 2012 at 457 pm

That advice flies directly in the face of one of the most well known poisons that can ruin a mans life and have him wake up at the end of his road full of regrets  Point by point.  For example, golden handcuffs

1. When you work hard at something you become good at it.

 Only if you have a talent for it and even then, you may do it just to pay the rent even though you hate it.

2. When you become good at doing something, you will enjoy it more.

A soldier defends hisher country usually by having to kill other human beings.  The vast majority of soldiers are good people that hate having to do that but are very good at it.

3. When you enjoy doing something, there is a very good chance you will become passionate or more passionate about it

 Again, paying the rent forces billions of us to become good at things we dont like or even hate.

4. When you are good at something, passionate and work even harder to excel and be the best at it, good things happen.

 Thats what happened to you.  For at least some of us, we got really good at things that were no longer valued as highly by the market place and got stuck with high expenses and increasingly dwindling revenues, including the brick wall incomestopper that was the recent global financial meltdown.

I normally agree with the vast majority of your posts but this isnt one of them.  The flip side for many entrepreneurs is that they make the other big mistake of trying to get rich and since they are not passionate about what they are creating, or at least the company they create, they dont have the energy to sustain themselves through the many years of struggling financially.  This blog post seems more controversial then salient.

I think it is equally important to match your skills, talents, and goals to your chosen career path, and then work hard at it. If you are playing out of position it will be much harder to succeed.

For example, if you weigh 300 lbs, are 511, and have short stubby fingers, then you probably wont be a good wide receiver no matter how hard you work at it or want it. If your IQ is about average, then you probably wont be a good nuclear physicist. If you arent physically attractive with a good vocabulary, then you probably ought not to choose a career as a TV News Anchor. If your goal is to be rich and famous then you probably ought to leave your current job as a UPS delivery man and try something more entrepreneurial.

I think Mark had great timing in when he sold his business, but Im sure he worked hard to get into that position.  There were plenty of other people who had the opportunity to do something similar, but he took the initiative and did it.  I agree with him that hard work is what will distinguish a successful person from someone who comes up short.  Most people just do not want to put in the blood, sweat, tears, but also the persistence, time, and sacrifice into become a leader in their field.  Think about people like Bill Gates and Steve Jobs who literally put every ounce of energy they had into their companies to become the best.

Best advice ever Mark..  Its so easy to say follow your passion..  Sometimes what you are passionate about wont make you in capital what you put your effort into.   Being passionate about something doesnt mean you will make money at it even with effort.  Find something that will make money and put effort into it so that you have the money to do the things you are passionate about.  Excellent advice Mark!

Randal Parker Mba  I dont see how you can say Mark made his money easily  Ive read about Marks early days. As I see it, he worked his ass off. Just because he took predictable steps that led to consistent success and then has been nice enough to share with others!  that doesnt mean it was easy.

Hey Walt disney you are silly to think you can follow your passion and build an entertainment brand around a mouseand forget about that passion of a theme park ha ha ha.. Steve Jobs I know you are passionate about technology but you and your friend Waz should give up on your passion. Hey Oprah, I understand you are passionate about helping people but come on a tv station, a tv showI believe the greatest people in the world Einstein, Gandi etc have all followed there passions.

youre playing semantics..or its a chickenegg issue. very difficult to put sustained, quality effort into something if youre not passionate about it.

I cant say I totally agree with this.  I spent a significant amount of my adult life working hard and becoming proficient in things I hated doing because society said I needed to do these things to become successful.  I was on a very secure road, but how happy was I?  Eventually, I threw all that away to take some time to look at myself in the mirror.  Now my quality of life has improved so drastically that even the people who questioned me let me know I made the right decision.

Find your own way because when you love what you do youll never work a day in your life.

1.  Take an honest look at yourself and sift through the things you enjoy, or may   enjoy, and narrow them down.

2.  When you enjoy what youre doing youll worker harder.

3.  When you work hard at something you care about, youll get good at it.

4.  When youre good at something that encompasses your joy and effort, good things happen.

The idea that youre suppose to know exactly what youre going to do with your life at 18 years old is bullshit.  Theres nothing wrong with bouncing around the things you love until you find one that becomes a viable career option for you.

I agree with what you are saying, but this is some of the worst advice I have ever seen you offer.

A gentleman once approached a famous entrepreneur I forget who, and told him his plans to make a great enterprise.  Said entrepreneur told him, essentially, You are full of shit, that will never work.

The gentlemen left the conversation with his tail between his legs.

The entrepreneur commented to a friend, If I can take away his dream, then he doesnt believe in it enough.

We dont need more dream stealers.  We need people who can assist those who want to change the world.

One of the biggest obstacles that you face is that you made your money too easily, and at too young an age.

Not everyone has your opportunity, and for you to push back against those that want to achieve, but who dont achieve that easily, is a disservice to humanity and to entrepreneurship.

Get off your high horse, and normalize your thinking.  You will help more people that way!

Mark Im on board 100 percent with your teachings! I just purchased your book last night and signed up for your blog. I really appreciate the things you say and HOW you say it. Im the type of guy who likes to hear it straight. Get to the point is what I find myself thinking too often. I feel like your blog postings are exactly that. You can say something better, more powerful, and more meaningful in a short blog posting than others would take to do so in a 500 page novel. I appreciate your hard work and example and look forward to learning more of the Cuban ways.

I think passion and efforthard work are not mutually exclusive to being successful, they are both important to being happy, successful and living a fulfilling life. One without the other will only get you so far and you will end up in mediocrity.

Follow your passion but not putting much effort into it is similar to someone with a great talent who never works towards developing it.

Ive been in situations where I followed my effort and not passion, made a very good living but I wasnt happy. Ive been in situations where I did what I had passion for and made less money and I was happier.

Bottom line they are both important and to each his own. Do whats good for you and will make you feel happy and accomplished!

Following my passion is often code for I dont like to work.

This is a great post, and a refreshing voice instead of more positive thinking nonsense.

I dont totally agree with you Mark. I think you need to be passionate about what you do if you want to be successful as an entrepreneur. Not everyone is able to be an entrepreneur. Their are always ups and downs and a lot of failures on the way. Without passion, its very hard to get through the downs or to pick yourself up after a failed venture. To say passion comes after success may be true, but you really do need that passion to reach success.
